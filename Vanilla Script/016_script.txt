JEIGUN:
, we've returned at long last.
We're back where it all began... 

PLAYER:
Yeah. 
It's a curious feeling.
It feels like yesterday that I first stepped
foot here and yet it seems so far away... 

JEIGUN:
Yes, I remember.
When you first arrived here for training,
you had no experience of battle. 
And now... 


MS016_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You've grown into one of the
continent's finest young soldiers. 
PLAYER, with you here, I have no doubt
that we can reclaim our homeland.
We're all counting on you. 


MS016_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You have gained much experience
as a knight of Altea. 
PLAYER, your efforts will decide whether
or not we will succeed in reclaiming Altea.
We're counting on you. 


MS016_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hmm...
You haven't really changed very much
from how you were back then. 
PLAYER, you must work harder on
the battlefield from now on.
I'm counting on you. 


MS016_OP1_1_PCF1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
How disgraceful...
Thieves inside our fair castle? 
What if they've stolen the Geosphere? 
*JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking
thief making his way north.
We should capture him before it's too late. 
*JEIGUN leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire, if you'd allow me the honor,
I will go.
Your orders, please. 


MS016_OP1_1_PCM1:

MARS:
How disgraceful...
They let thieves inside the castle? 
What if they've stolen the Geosphere?

JEIGUN:
Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking
thief making his way north.
We should capture him before it's too late. 
*JEIGUN leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire, if necessary,
I shall recover it.
Your orders, my lord!

*MARS enters**MISHRAN enters*
MISHRAN:
Prince Marth.
Please, hold on. 

MARS:
Macellan!
Did you come here with Dolph? 

MISHRAN:
Correct. Dolph and I are going
to be your reinforcements.
Archanea has nothing left for me. 
For the justice that I believe in,
allow me to fight by your side again,
Prince Marth.

*JORJUE enters**ASTRIA enters*
JORJUE:
Astram! 

ASTRIA:
Well, if it isn't the turncoat, Jeorge.
What form of death would you prefer? 

JORJUE:
H-hold your sword, Astram.
Even if you fight here,
you've no chance of winning. 

ASTRIA:
You would have me surrender...? 
Never! Though I may be the last
man standing, I shall fight on.
I am a soldier of Archanea! 

JORJUE:
Why do you fight?
For whom?
Emperor Hardin? 

ASTRIA:
I think not!
Not for him. 
For Princess Nyna...
For Archanea!! 

JORJUE:
Then tell me, was it Princess Nyna
who ordered you to arms? 
Do you honestly believe that Princess
Nyna would wish for a war like this? 

ASTRIA:
She...!
I have not seen the princess in some time. 
She has been ill of late. 
Hardin is the ruler of Archanea and my liege.
I've no choice but to obey. 
If I do not, then I betray Archanea.
And I betray Princess Nyna. 

JORJUE:
Astram, Princess Nyna entrusted Marth
with the Fire Emblem. 
Do you understand what that entails? 

ASTRIA:
C-come again?!
What are you trying to tell me, Jeorge? 
Are you suggesting that Princess
Nyna asked Prince Marth for help? 

JORJUE:
Is there any other reason? 
Come with us, Astram.
See the truth with your own eyes. 
If you die here, how would Midia feel? 
Live, Astram, for her.
Live, and face the truth of what
has come to pass. 

ASTRIA:
Hmm... I suppose it is unavoidable.
But, Jeorge-- 
Should I learn that this war is a
product of Marth's ambition,
as Emperor Hardin claims... 
Heads will roll.
Am I clear? 


MS016_EV1:
*WILLOW enters**SOLDIER_RED enters*
SOLDIER_RED:
Lord Willow, permission to open the
door and attack? 

WILLOW:
Wait.
Don't be so hasty. 
Inform me as soon as any of the chests
in the treasury are opened.
We will sortie the moment that happens. 
Both the thieves and the Alteans will
want their greasy hands on the loot. 
While they're busy trying to unload
the chests, we will take that chance
and attack. 
Heh heh...
This is a battle of intellect, not brawn. 
Don't forget!
Attack when the chests are sprung! 


MS016_EV2:
*WILLOW enters*
INSERTNAMEHERE:
What's that?
The chests have been sprung?
Now! Open the door! 
Heh heh heh!
Their panicked faces will be glorious! 


MS016_BT_ASTRIA:

ASTRIA:
Traitors!
You will feel Mercurius's bite!!

The terror of my magic...!

Sire.
It's over. 
*PLAYER leaves**JEIGUN enters*

At long last,
Altea is ours once more. 

MARS:
We've all the reason to be happy.
But is there news of Elice...?

*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
Prince Marth...
Can you hear me? 
I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings,
but it would seem that Princess Elice
has been kidnapped by Gharnef. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gotoh... Do you speak truly?! 

S_GATO:
I have found out that Gharnef
commanded his priests to search for
clerics of noble birth. 
*MARS enters*
S_GATO:
It is most likely that Lena and your
sister were spirited away by Gharnef. 

MARS:
It can't be! 
What does he intend to do with them!? 

S_GATO:
That, I do not know.
But something foul is on the cards. 
There can be no doubt of Gharnef's
involvement in this series
of unfortunate events. 

MARS:
Lord Gotoh!
Where is Gharnef now? 

S_GATO:
I believe Princess Nyna is his next target.
He is probably... at Archanea's palace. 

MARS:
I understand.
Then I too shall go to Archanea. 
I still have to free Hardin from
the Darksphere's influence. 
I will defeat the Dark Pontifex
Gharnef, and rescue my sister--no,
I'll save all of them!
