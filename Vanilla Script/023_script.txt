MARS:
, just ahead is the Dark Pontifex,
Gharnef--possibly the strongest
sorcerer alive... or dead. 
PLAYER... 


MS023_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your resistance to magic is impeccable.
You might just be our strongest hope of
defeating Gharnef. 
Yes.
If you are there, then... we stand to win. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Sire... I'm honored.
I'll give it my all! 


MS023_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You're fairly resistant to magic,
but you'd be at risk facing Gharnef. 
If you must fight him, please take
all the necessary precautions. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, sire.
Thank you. 


MS023_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You're not very resistant to magic... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
T-that's, er, true... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
'Twould be best if you avoided Gharnef.
But in any case, please be extra careful. 


MS023_OP1:
*MARS enters**GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
So you've come, boy.
How many times must you get in my way?
Enough! I tire of our games!! 

MARS:
Gharnef, what have you done with
my sister and the others?!
Release them at once! 

GARNEF:
Heh heh heh... I've allowed them the honor
of being sacrifices for the Shadow Dragon's
resurrection. You will never see them again. 
Emperor Medeus will soon be reborn
in his true and darkest form.
And they will usher in a new era. 
'Tis a pity. Their souls couldn't bear
the suffering and shattered into pieces...
Even I am powerless to help them. 
Shame, really. I have them to thank for
the Shadow Dragon's awakening. Not even the
Binding Shield can stop him now. 
I applaud you for coming this far.
But... little prince...
you will go no further. 
I will kill you here, and you will die
knowing that you are nothing!! 


MS023_BT_BOSS:
*GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
Heh heh heh...
Perhaps...
a taste of Imhullu's might is necessary. 


MS023_BT_BOSS_MARS:
*GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
Your blade is blunt before me, Marth...
I'll smash you and the Binding Shield
into pieces!! 
*MARS enters*
MARS:
I do not intend to fall here.
Out of my way, Gharnef! 


MS023_BT_BOSS_PC_PCF1:
*GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
Heh heh heh...
Allow me demonstrate Imhullu's might... 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
I will not let Prince Marth die.
I won't...! 


MS023_BT_BOSS_PC_PCM1:
*GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
Heh heh heh...
Allow me demonstrate Imhullu's might... 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
I will not let Prince Marth die.
I won't let the likes of you lay
even a finger on him...! 


MS023_DIE_BOSS:
*GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
Heh heh...
You're too late...
The end is nigh... 


MS023_ED1_PCF1:

PLAYER:
Sire, this way.
There are stairs here, leading up.

Sire, this way.
More stairs!
