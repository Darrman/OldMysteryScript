*JEIGUN enters**PLAYER enters*PLAYER
JEIGUN:
, you should be aware that Lang
is a general with high defense. 
To defeat him, you would do well to attack
with magic or a special weapon like an
armorslayer. 

PLAYER:
Duly noted. 

JEIGUN:
If you plan to defeat him with strength alone,
you'd have to be extremely powerful. 


MS006_OP0_A:
PLAYER
INSERTNAMEHERE:
, your strength is simply tremendous.
Against a blow from you, Lang's armor would
crumple like paper. 
Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes sir! 


MS006_OP0_B:
PLAYER
INSERTNAMEHERE:
, your strength is quite impressive.
You might just be able to defeat Lang. 
Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man. 


MS006_OP0_C:
PLAYER
INSERTNAMEHERE:
, you are, sadly, not very strong.
But you could fight using your other talents. 
Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man. 


MS006_OP1:
*RANG enters*
RANG:
Heh heh heh...
So the Alteans have come. 
Reinforcements are arriving soon;
if we can hold out a little longer,
we can make a pincer attack. 
*NABARL enters*
RANG:
Swordsman Navarre.
When they open that door, you make your
move. 
There is no need for restraint;
slice them to pieces! 

NABARL:
Yeah... Sure.
Though the knights of Altea are hardly
worthy enemies. 

RANG:
Oh-ho! That's my Navarre.
They say not even Ogma of Talys is your
equal. 

NABARL:
What? Ogma?!
N... Naturally...
A guy like him is no match for me. 

RANG:
I see. Glad to hear it.
Then I'll leave this place in your capable
hands, Navarre! 


MS006_EV0:
*JEIGUN enters**MARS enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, there seems to be movement near
the front of the castle. And it would
appear to be moving towards our forces. 

MARS:
Are they enemy reinforcements?
Or allies to our cause...? 

JEIGUN:
I do not know, but...
I do hope they are allies. 


MS006_EV1:
*FREY enters*
FREY:
Sire! 
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Frey!
Thank goodness you're safe. 

FREY:
You too, sire.
Norne and I escaped from Altea Castle
and we rode here as fast as we could. 
*FREY leaves**NORN enters*
NORN:
But the rest of our forces were scattered...
I'm sorry we couldn't all make it. 

MARS:
You don't have to apologize,
I'm just glad that you're safe.
The others can take care of themselves. 
*NORN leaves**FREY enters*
FREY:
Sire.
From here on we shall accompany you.
Please give us your orders. 
*FREY leaves**NORN enters*
NORN:
Oh, and please be careful!
I caught a glimpse of enemy troops
approachin' the castle behind us. 
I expect they'll be enterin' the castle soon. 

MARS:
Enemy reinforcements?
I understand. Thank you. 


MS006_TK1:
*RICARD enters**JURIAN enters*
JURIAN:
Hey, Rickard!
I see you haven't tired of stealin'. 

RICARD:
Ah! Chief!
How nice to see ya. 
Well, I was plannin' on workin' with you and
makin' loadsa money, but you had to go and
quit the business! 
Fallin' head over heels for that beautiful
cleric, and then dumpin' me...
That's just too cruel! 
Did our love really mean that little to you? 

JURIAN:
Can it, you little fink!!
People'll get the wrong idea about us,
if you keep talkin' like that. 
Anyway, forget about thievin' and come with
me to fight for justice. 

RICARD:
Hmm... alright then! 
I'll follow you anywhere.
I do adore ya, Chief! 


MS006_TK2:
*NABARL enters**SHEEDA enters*
SHEEDA:
Navarre, please hear me out!
Lend your sword to our cause, just once
more! 

NABARL:
What? Who are you?
I'll have no business with women or children... 
But, there's a first for everything...
(Whoa, she's smoking!)
What business do you have with me? 



MS006_TK2_01:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
......
Y-you're not Navarre!
Who are you? 



MS006_TK2_02:
*SAMTO enters*
SAMTO:
Yikes, I've been exposed, huh?
I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as
Samto. 
Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this
famous "Navarre" swordsman guy. 
I got tired of it after a while, so I decided
to pose as him and got myself hired. 
But I don't like this General Lang guy either. 
If you're alright with it, I'll lend you my sword. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes...
You'll do just fine... 


MS006_TK3:
*NABARL enters**OGUMA enters*
OGUMA:
Navarre...
You bastard... 

NABARL:
Stay away... This evening, my killing edge
hungers for blood... 

OGUMA:
Do you mean to kill me, no matter what? 
Hmph, very well.
I knew that we'd have to settle our score
eventually. 



MS006_TK3_01:
*SAMTO enters*
SAMTO:
Wait...
Stay your blade!
...I'm no Navarre, I'm just a sham. 
I... It's me, Samto.
Have you forgotten, Ogma? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Samto?!
Samto, the gladiator from Knorda? 

SAMTO:
Yes, I was a slave gladiator at the time,
and you really helped me out. 
Even when everyone was making their
escape, you stayed behind to distract
the guards and ended up caught... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
...... 

SAMTO:
I heard everything from my friends. 
How you were dragged out to the square
and whipped until you looked like a corpse. 
How, by chance, the young Princess Talys,
tears in her eyes, stood up for you and
saved you. 
And that's why you swore your blade
to Talys. 
Or rather... to the princess... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Enough... Say no more!
No more. It's in the past now...
No more... 

SAMTO:
...Ogma... 
Anyway, I want to repay you!
I'm following you from now on, okay? 


MS006_BT_BOSS:
*RANG enters*
RANG:
W-wait, please!
I'm sorry... Please forgive me... 
I've only done as the Emperor ordered me to. 
I didn't agree with him, but I had no choice. 
So... so please, s-spare my life... 
I'll do anything you say.
Yes... Just like this... 
Mwahaha!
You shouldn't have let your guard down!
You fool... Now die! 


MS006_BT_BOSS_MARS:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
General Lang, I have--with my own eyes--
witnessed a number of your crimes. 
I cannot forgive you.
But if you have something to say,
I will listen. 
*RANG enters*
RANG:
S-silence... silence!
You damned country-boy prince! 
You're a fool for coming here!
Just die already! 
*MARS leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
Is that your answer?
Then prepare yourself! 


MS006_BT_BOSS_PC_PCF1:
*RANG enters*
RANG:
Y-you!
You're that impertinent little girl from
before...! 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Lang!
You have oppressed countless people,
and insulted my liege. 
You can only atone for these sins with your
life! 
*RANG leaves**RANG enters*
RANG:
W... Why you! 


MS006_BT_BOSS_PC_PCM1:

Chief, where aaare ya? 


MS006_BT_SAMTO:

I pity your soul.
But I can at least grant you a quick death.
Take this! My killing edge!! 


MS006_DIE_BOSS:
*RANG enters*
RANG:
Urgh...
Impossible...
I have been defeated... 


MS006_DIE_RICARD:
*RICARD enters*
RICARD:
Tch. Man, I messed up big time. 


MS006_DIE_SAMTO:
*SAMTO enters*
SAMTO:
Doh, I shouldn't have said that I was
Navarre... 


MS006_ED1:
*MARS enters**WENDEL enters*
MARS:
Lord Wendell!
Thank goodness you're unharmed. 

WENDEL:
Lang accused me of collaborating with
the rebels and had me imprisoned. 
Even though I told him that I must fulfill a
mission assigned to me by Archsage Gotoh... 

MARS:
A mission from Lord Gotoh? 

WENDEL:
That's correct... 
You have seen the "Starsphere"--
the holy orb with the twelve constellations
etched on its surface. 
In order to pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil,
Lord Gotoh created a sacred spell named
"Starlight" from that orb. 


MS006_ED1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Unfortunately, the strain on the Starsphere
was so severe that it shattered into twelve
shards, which scattered into the sky. 
Lord Gotoh told me that this world has long
been guarded by five orbs of mysterious
arcane power, 
and that if even one of them is lost,
the world will fall into irreparable ruin. 
By any means possible, we must gather the
twelve star shards and restore the
Starsphere. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Is... Is this a joke?
That the world could just end...
This is all very hard to take in. 
But aren't these the star shards? 
If so, we already have a few. 
After we retake Altea, we'd be glad to help
you find the remaining shards and orbs. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Of course...
Your country was only just invaded by the
Empire... 
I understand, Prince...
I too shall fight to restore Altea, then. 
Thinking about it, my meeting with you
is like a sign from Lord Gotoh himself. 
In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate. 
But, please, let's stop by the Fane of Raman. 
We may be able to find some star shards in
the ancient temple. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Understood.
If it's the Fane of Raman, we can go there
on our way to Altea! 


MS006_ED1_ADD:
*PLAYER enters**MARS enters*
MARS:
General Lang has been defeated.
And now the people of Grust no longer have
to suffer. 

PLAYER:
That's right, sire. 
PLAYER
MARS:
, since leaving Altea, we've had a
great deal of fights... 
Looking back at them now... 


MS006_ED1_ADD_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
None of our companions were hurt and none
of them died. That's what I'm happiest about. 
PLAYER, it's because you've been here.
Thank you so much. 


MS006_ED1_ADD_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It couldn't be helped, but...
Some of our comrades were injured or
passed on. 
I don't want to lose anyone from now. 
I know we can do it if you're there.
PLAYER, please, help me. 


MS006_ED1_ADD_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
All I remember is seeing our companions fall,
one by one... 
Enough! I don't want any of our comrades to
suffer that pain. PLAYER, please, help me. 


MS006_ED2:
*JEIGUN enters**MARS enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, some new information has come in from
the patrol. 
Just ahead, the enemy seems to be
preparing some kind of ambush. 
It's not the Archanean Empire, but likely,
I fear, mercenaries hired with coin. 

MARS:
Mercenaries, is it...?
Do we continue as we are or take a longer,
safer route? 
Personally, I'd rather not detour.
We have to return to Altea as soon as
possible. 

JEIGUN:
Hmph, if you would allow me to speak as
your tactician... I think we ought to stay
here and fight. 
We will be facing mercenaries.
The Altean knights would never lose to mere
mercenaries. 
*MARS leaves**PLAYER enters**JEIGUN leaves**MARS enters*PLAYER
MARS:
, your thoughts? 

PLAYER:
I agree with Sir Jagen. 


MS006_ED2_Y:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
I see, thank you.
Jagen, PLAYER! 
The whole army shall move on as they were.
We'll hit the mercenaries head-on!
