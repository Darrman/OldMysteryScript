JEIGUN:
Well, PLAYER, is everyone making good use
of the drill grounds? 
Of course, if you win often, you'll be that
much stronger. 
PLAYER, you... 


MS013_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Oho-ho, you...
You've done very well, haven't you? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, I go there often. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see. Then there is nothing I have to add.
I should recommend the drill grounds to the
others. 


MS013_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Oho-ho, you...
You've been winning quite often, eh?
Not bad at all. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Thank you.
But I hope to improve further. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
That's the spirit!
I should recommend the drill grounds to the
others. 


MS013_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hmm, you...
It seems you haven't won much yet. 
Are you purposely avoiding the drill grounds? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
S-sorry, I don't really have the money, so... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well, it's fine if you're not struggling now,
but when things get tough, that experience
will be the clincher. 
Just remember, if you ever feel that your
foes are too strong, there is a place where
you can hone your skills.

2*MARS enters**CHEINE enters*
MARS:
Are we there yet, Xane?
We've climbed so high already. 
It's freezing and...
It's becoming increasingly difficult to
breathe... 

CHEINE:
Just hang on a bit longer, princey. 
Look, you can see it, right?
That's the Ice Dragon Shrine over there.
Where Gotoh's waitin' for you. 

MARS:
You know, I must admit, I was shocked when
you told me that Tiki was the daughter of
the Divine Dragon King. 
And that you and Gotoh were both divine
dragons. 

CHEINE:
Oh, yeah... but y'see, after the war, Gotoh
and I threw away our dragon stones.
So, I can never be a dragon again. 
Sure, Gotoh still stands by Naga's command
and watches out for humans... 
But that ain't my thing. 
Y'see, I don't like humans. 
I've got nothin' but contempt for those
who treated the defenseless Manaketes like
insects. 
So I can understand why Medeus despised
you humans so. 
Medeus, an Earth Dragon prince, was the
only one of his tribe who become a Manakete. 
And, as ordered by Naga, he guarded the
Dragon's Altar. 
But the once peaceful human race, drunk
with power, began to rule with tyranny. 
They oppressed the dragons who had done
nothin' wrong. 
Furious at their betrayal by humans,
the Manaketes gathered in Dolhr, 
and they created a nation for their people.
Then they fought to conquer humanity. 
To save the humans, Gotoh gave them the
divine sword Falchion. 
He established an academy in Khadein,
and began to teach magic. 
Me? I was just an onlooker.
Winner or loser, it was no concern of mine. 

MARS:
But then, why help me?
I too am human... 

CHEINE:
You're different.
And you seem kind of flaky.
I can't exactly leave you alone... 

MARS:
Err...
Thanks, Xane. 

CHEINE:
I... Oh, look at me.
I'm blushin'. 
Anyway, let's head to the shrine.
But watch out for the ice dragons. 
Even though they've lost their minds,
they still protect the shrine instinctively.
The poor creatures...

MARS:
You, you're Beck!
To think we'd meet here of all places! 

BECK:
Me too, Prince Marth.
Boy am I surprised to see you.
It's been far too long. 
After the war, I was travelin' the continent.
And, um, somehow... 

MARS:
...You landed up here?
Well, thank goodness. There's no way you
would have joined the barbarians. 
Beck, we're fighting another war.
Why don't you come with us? 

BECK:
I don't have my ballista any more.
Just my horse-buddy right 'ere. 
But if you're fine with that, then sure.
I'll help you princey.

INSERTNAMEHERE:
2*MARS enters**CHEINE enters*
MARS:
There's something that's been bothering me. 
The five orbs are very important, correct?
But Lord Gotoh never told us much about
them. 
Do you know anything about them, Xane? 

CHEINE:
Well, Gotoh kept his lips shut 'cause he was
afraid of givin' you a heart attack. 
Tell you what, I'll tell you about 'em.
But I have to warn you, it's a looooong story. 
The orbs are meant for the shield that binds
the earth dragons... 
In other words, they were once embedded in
the shield itself. 
The orbs have been handed down for
generations amongst the divine dragons
and each contains a hidden power. 
The shield itself is but a pedestal for the
five orbs to release their innate powers. 
If even one orb is missing, the seal's a goner. 

MARS:
I see.
But if that's the case, why were the orbs
separated? 

CHEINE:
'Cause the shield broke. 
The Binding Shield that was enshrined in the
Fane of Raman was stolen. 

MARS:
When exactly did this happen? 

CHEINE:
Six hundred years ago, I reckon.
Gotoh scoured the lands searchin' for the
shield, hopin' to get it back. 
He managed to retrieve the five orbs,
but in the end, he couldn't find the shield. 
Then, in the last war... 
The Fane of Raman was looted and the orbs
were scattered once more. 

MARS:
I see.
So the orbs that Lord Gotoh lost...
He's searching for them again? 

CHEINE:
Yep. I'm sure you know about the Starsphere,
Lightsphere and Geosphere... 
But there's also the Darksphere and
Lifesphere. 
Gotoh's got the Lightsphere, but the
Starsphere's in pieces, 
and it sounds like Gharnef gave the
Darksphere to Hardin. 

MARS:
The Geosphere is in Altea, so all that remains
is the Lifesphere. 

CHEINE:
Anyway, let's go inside.
I'll be helpin' you too.
Now, come on, princey!

*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
JEIGUN:
I just received a distressing message.
People have been sighted not far behind us. 
There seems to be a battle underway. 

MARS:
Out here?
Could it be the barbarians?
Or perhaps it's the assassins... 

JEIGUN:
In any case, this area is almost entirely
uninhabited. So it can't be any old people... 
To make matters worse, the snow is becoming
heavier... Fighting will be difficult in this
weather. 

MARS:
But if there are allies... 
*JEIGUN leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Indeed. We cannot abandon them.
If there are allies that is... 



MS013_ED2_Y:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Then we'll just have to find out for ourselves,
before the battle is over. Let's go!
