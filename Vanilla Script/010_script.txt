*PLAYER enters**MARS enters*
PLAYER:
So this is the School of Khadein...
The sanctuary of those who study magic. 

MARS:
Indeed, Merric studied here since he was a
child. 
I personally have no magical ability, but
as for you, PLAYER... 


MS010_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You're incredible.
I don't think you'd lose to even Merric. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I wonder if I could study here, in Khadein? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Actually, I think they'd want you to teach. 


MS010_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You have potential.
I'm sure you'd qualify to study here. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Thank you, sire. 


MS010_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You too, hm...?
You're not very good at magic either. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yeah... I'm not really cut out for it. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well, everyone has their own talents.
I wouldn't worry too much about it. 


MS010_OP1:
*MARICH enters**ELREAN enters*
ELREAN:
Merric.
It's time to put an end to this. 

MARICH:
Wait, Elrean!
Why do we have to fight? 
We were both Master Wendell's pupils:
we're friends, are we not?
Why do you despise me so? 

ELREAN:
I was Master Wendell's disciple before you,
and I was the stronger one. 
Even so, Master Wendell gave you Excalibur.
He should have given it to me! 
Clearly, I was the only one worthy to be his
successor, yet he... 

MARICH:
But I have no intention of succeeding
Master Wendell. 
I hold no ill feelings for Khadein, but once I
finish studying I plan to go home. 
Back in Altea, there is somebody I must
protect for the rest of my life... 
So, Elrean, please!
Why don't you join us so we can take back
Altea? 

ELREAN:
Altea, you say?! 
Why should we help a country that rebelled
against the empire and attempted to invade
their fair nation? 
The mage corps of Khadein have sworn
allegiance to Emperor Hardin. 
Oh, I see... I knew it was you...
YOU dragged the Altean army here! 

MARICH:
No!!
That's not how it is! 

ELREAN:
Shut your mouth, traitor!!
I won't listen to your lies any longer! 
Your Excalibur and my Thoron;
we'll put them to the test! 


MS010_EV1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Everyone, we must rescue Merric!
However, the enemies include clerics who cannot fight. 
It would seem that they are being
threatened by the enemy. 
Please, try not to hurt them. 


MS010_TK1:
*WENDEL enters**ELREAN enters*
WENDEL:
Elrean!
What are you doing?! 

ELREAN:
Master Wendell... 

WENDEL:
You still don't understand my decision,
do you? 
Indeed, as a mage, your power surpasses
mine. 
But you lack compassion.
That is why I did not grant you Excalibur. 

ELREAN:
...
Compassion...? 

WENDEL:
I had decided that you were to be my
successor when the time came. 
To think you would harbor a grudge towards
me... Does that not make you the same as
Gharnef? 

ELREAN:
The same as Gharnef...?
Teacher! What are you saying? 

WENDEL:
Elrean, listen to me...
Gharnef, along with Pontifex Miloah, were
Lord Gotoh's best pupils. 
But Lord Gotoh saw Gharnef's weakness,
and so he left Khadein and the Aura tome
to Pontifex Miloah. 
Gharnef, overcome by jealousy, stole the
Darksphere from Lord Gotoh, and created
the Imhullu tome. 
As a result...
His heart was trapped within the Darksphere
for all eternity. 
Wrath and envy led him to ruin.
Do you understand now, Elrean...? 

ELREAN:
...Teacher... 
...Teacher!
I'm so sorry. 
I... I was wrong. 
Please... find it in your heart to forgive me! 

WENDEL:
Elrean, you will use that power of yours for
the good of the people. 
Understand? 


MS010_BT_JUCAPH:
*ELREAN enters*
ELREAN:
I won't lose to someone like Merric.
Anyone who sides with him is my enemy.
Thunder, strike them down! Thoron!! 


MS010_BT_JUCAPH_WENDEL:
*ELREAN enters*
ELREAN:
Why does everyone side with HIM...?
Even though... even though I'm stronger! 
*WENDEL enters*
WENDEL:
How horrible...
Consumed by your hatred, you have
forgotten what is truly important. 


MS010_DIE_JUCAPH:

Sire, we've rescued the clerics.

Excellent.
Good work, PLAYER. 

PLAYER:
As thanks, they have offered to give us this.

threatened by the enemy.

*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
Marth...
Do you hear me? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gotoh!
Yes, I can. You are speaking to me through
magic, are you not? 
Lord Gotoh, I must ask: what has happened
to cause Hardin to suddenly change so
much? 

S_GATO:
Hmm... The Darksphere is the culprit...
Hardin's soul is trapped within the
Darksphere... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
The Darksphere?
What on earth is that? 



MS010_ED1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Light, Star, Earth, Life and Darkness...
In this world, there exist five sacred orbs. 
The Darksphere is that which complements
the Lightsphere; 
in battle, it possesses the enemy's mind,
negating their attacks. 
But the Darksphere also amplifies wrath and
envy, and can turn its owner into a demon. 
Hardin must have obtained the Darksphere
from somewhere...
And now his heart has been lost to it. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
But why? He should have been happy after
his union with his beloved Princess Nyna,
so why the envy? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Prince...
Humans are never simple creatures... 
In any case, the only object that can
overcome Hardin's Darksphere is the
Lightsphere. 
If you want to do something about him,
then you had best come and get it from me. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh? Really, Lord Gotoh?
If we have the Lightsphere then we can
save Hardin? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well... If his heart is not completely consumed,
then perhaps. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gotoh!
Please, lend the Lightsphere to me. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
If you come in person to the Ice Dragon
Shrine where I reside, then you shall have it. 
But that will be no easy task. 
So, Marth.
Do you have the courage to walk the path
that Anri walked? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, I do! I will go!!
Please, allow me to go! 
I must have the Lightsphere! 


MS010_ED2_ADD:
*PLAYER enters**JEIGUN enters*PLAYER
JEIGUN:
, may I have a word?
As this army's strategist, I have been
observing each and every of our battles. 
If I were to sum up your recent style of
fighting, I would say... 


MS010_ED2_ADD_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Most impressive! To the end. 
All of your comrades support each other,
and you fight as one, so as to not lose
each other. 
With Prince Marth as our core...
and your support, we shall not falter. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It is an honor, Sir Jagen. 


MS010_ED2_ADD_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Excellent! There is no other word. 
At times we lose comrades...
But even so, we have always prevailed. 
With Prince Marth as our core...
and your support, we shall not falter. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It is an honor, Sir Jagen. 


MS010_ED2_ADD_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Unsatisfactory...
It pains me to say it. 
But your comrades have fallen, one after
another... At this rate, I worry for the future. 
You must protect them from now on.
Their lives are in your hands, PLAYER. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, Sir Jagen. 


MS010_ED_BS:
*PLAYER enters**MARIS enters*
MARIS:
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
I came here 'cause I heard Marth's group
was passing by, but, erm... 

PLAYER:
Sorry, who are you? 

MARIS:
I'm Maris.
A mercenary, and not a cheap one. 
I'd like to ask you something:
is yer prince okay with paying gold? 
Oh, of course, it's okay if I have to wait
until this war's over.
So, erm... 
If you, er, paid us, say... 590 gold for our
services, that ought to do, I think. 

PLAYER:
Huh? If it's only that much, then
Prince Marth would gladly pay... 

MARIS:
Phew! The rumors are true.
He's completely different from all our
employers up till now. Right, Pops? 
*MARIS leaves**DICE enters*
DICE:
He IS different.
Looks like we hit the jackpot coming to this
desert. 
I'm Dice.
On behalf of the both of us,
it's great to be in your service. 


MS010_ED3:

Sire, we've just received new information. 
It concerns the assassins' movements...
Lord Horace, who thought to ally with us,
is in peril.

Lord Horace...!

, Lord Horace is an Archanean
knight in Princess Nyna's service.
He was our ally.
