MARS:
, if we can get through this pass
we will be on Archanea's doorstep.
Just hang in there a little longer. 

PLAYER:
Yes, sire. 

MARS:
Despite all the odds,
we've surpassed Anri's Way
and taken back Altea... 
The battles we've faced up to now...
have been nothing short of difficult.
And in those battles... 


MS018_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
We've managed to keep everyone alive. 
With the strength of all our comrades,
we can accomplish something worthy of Anri... 
I'm so proud of everyone. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Sire...... 


MS018_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It's thanks to our friends that
our country is free;
I cannot help but think of the fallen. 
I want to become stronger for them.
From now on, let's live so that
no one falls again... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Sire...... 


MS018_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
...The feeling of pain overwhelms me.
When I think of the severely wounded,
and the many who have fallen... 
Perhaps if I had been stronger like Anri,
then everyone would still be alive... 
From now...
From now on, I will definitely... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Sire......

ROSHE:
Wolf, Sedgar, Vyland.
Do you not have second thoughts...?
Does the battle plan not trouble you? 
*WOLF enters*
WOLF:
Roshea!
Are you still babbling on about
that nonsense? 
Look over there!
The Altean forces are stretched along
the narrow pass. 
Our only chance to crush them is now. 
*WOLF leaves**BIRAKU enters*
BIRAKU:
What's wrong with you, Roshea?
Did the four of us not all pledge that
we would die for Coyote? 
It was Coyote who freed us
plain dwellers from slavery. 
If we don't fight Altea here,
then we can't protect the palace. 
Are you telling me you WANT
Hardin to be defeated by them? 
*BIRAKU leaves**ZAGARO enters*
ZAGARO:
That's right!
Prince Marth wants to destroy
Archanea and everything we hold dear. 
If we leave him be, the entire world
will eventually fall into his hands. 

ROSHE:
I still find it hard to believe.
So the honorable Prince Marth we met is
supposed to harbor diabolical ambitions? 
*ZAGARO leaves**WOLF enters*
WOLF:
Are you calling Coyote a liar?! 
Do you really believe that he would
resort to such deceitful tactics?! 
Enough, Roshea!!
I've lost all respect for you.
Betray us if you want, I don't care. 
Sedgar, Vyland, let's go.
If we delay any more they will pass us. 

ROSHE:
Hey, wait!
You know I can't betray you.
I understand... I'll go, too. 


MS018_EV1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
The Wolfguard of Aurelis!
Must we fight them as well...? 
*JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, please hold on.
We've just received word from a
messenger of King Aurelis. 
It seems Aurelis has no plans to war... 


MS018_EV1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
According to the messenger, King Aurelis
wishes to parley with you in the village. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
What? What could this mean?
That the Wolfguard is moving independent
of Aurelis's orders? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I don't know, but... Depending on
how negotiations go, it's possible
the Wolfguard may signal a retreat. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see. It would benefit us all
if we could avoid pointless fighting.
Let's hurry to the village! 


MS018_VIL1:
*MARS enters**ORLEAN_KING enters*
ORLEAN_KING:
Oh, Prince Marth.
Thank the stars I could meet you here. 

MARS:
King Aurelis?
What brings you here? 

ORLEAN_KING:
I came to halt our attack.
And I must apologize to you. 
I believed Hardin and sided with Archanea,
but it seems that I made a mistake. 
Aurelis has decided to maintain neutrality.
My knights will return to their lands. 

MARS:
I understand, Your Majesty.
I do not wish to fight you, either. 
Please, find it in yourself to forgive me
for the many Aurelian lives that I've taken. 

ORLEAN_KING:
Ohh!
The rumors are true, as I suspected. 
I am old and frail, and without children.
And now, the brother I once trusted
has become... like this. 
Prince Marth, please,
protect Aurelis in my stead.
I entrust everything to you. 
As a sign of my allegiance,
I would have you accept this orb. 

MARS:
Your Majesty, Hardin is... 

ORLEAN_KING:
Do not worry about my younger brother. 
A knight can only die a knight's death.
'Twas always his fate... 


MS018_BT_BIRAKU:
*BIRAKU enters*
BIRAKU:
As long as we're around
you will not reach the palace.
If you value your lives then turn around! 


MS018_BT_ROSHE:
*ROSHE enters*
ROSHE:
I am Roshea of the Wolfguard.
I don't want to fight, but I will not
betray my friends. I'm sorry... 


MS018_BT_WOLF:
*WOLF enters*
WOLF:
I am Wolf, commander of the Wolfguard.
Your head is mine! 


MS018_BT_ZAGARO:
*ZAGARO enters*
ZAGARO:
You...
Why are you invading other countries?
Are you so blinded by your ambition?!

MARS:
, we've made it through.
The palace is not far. 
I have only you to thank for this.
You do nothing but help me. 

PLAYER:
No, it's not like that.
It was your decision, sire.
I just came up with the idea. 

MARS:
That's hardly the whole truth. 
The times when I'm lost in my thoughts,
if you're there, I have confidence.
I'm thankful for that; more than anything. 
*PLAYER leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we've just received urgent news.
Apparently a coup d'etat broke out
in the palace. 
The knights and citizens who opposed
Emperor Hardin's ways rose in rebellion. 

MARS:
What in the blazes?!
What has happened to them now? 

JEIGUN:
Unfortunately, the instigators were all
defeated and captured... 
Rumor has it that the rebels
are being executed by the day. 

MARS:
Damn it, Hardin...
This is absurd. 
*JEIGUN leaves**PLAYER enters*
MARS:
It's decided. We will head for
the palace at once and end this.
PLAYER, let's go!! 

PLAYER:
Yes, sire!

No, not at all..
I just made a random suggestion. 

MARS:
That's hardly the whole truth. 
The times when I'm lost in my thoughts,
if you're there, I have confidence.
I'm thankful for that; more than anything.
