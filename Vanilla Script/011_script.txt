MARS:
Huh...? 
W-who's there? 

PLAYER:
Sire, it's me, PLAYER. 

MARS:
Oh, it's just you....
You had me startled for a moment.
Especially with that mask on you... 

PLAYER:
Is it that strange? 

MARS:
Well... perhaps a little.
Do you mean to fight like that? 

PLAYER:
Yes. 

MARS:
I-I see.

MARS:
Jagen, where in the world are we...? 
*JEIGUN leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
This is the path depicted in the Anri Saga. 
The first obstacle in Anri's Way:
the Desert of Death. 
With its scorching sun, raging sandstorm,
savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns
that soar and dominate the skies. 
As the city of illusion shimmers in the
distance, we can only stand and gaze...
Or so the legend has it. 

MARS:
So Anri came through here as well.
And by himself, too... 

JEIGUN:
That's right. Your ancestor and Altea's
founder, King Anri... 
To save Princess Artemis, he set out on a
journey to seek the divine sword Falchion. 

MARS:
King Anri was strong.
I wouldn't be able to cross through here
alone. 
I'm truly grateful to those who offered
to accompany me through this desert.

PLAYER:
I think everybody wishes to follow you, sire. 
Everyone wants to be with you.
Wherever you go, they will follow.
That's what I believe. 
It's because of your kindness, sire. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Thank you.
I don't have Anri's power.
But I have all of you. 
Wonderful companions like you, PLAYER.
That's how I can keep going. 
Let's go, PLAYER. 

PLAYER:
Understood.

You are strong, sire. 
Everyone wants to be with you.
Wherever you go, they will follow.
That's what I believe. 
That's something you have
that King Anri never did. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Thank you.
I don't have Anri's power.
But I have all of you. 
Wonderful companions like you, PLAYER.
That's why I won't give up. 
Let's go, PLAYER. 

PLAYER:
Understood.

SHEEDA:
Jake!
What are you doing all the way out here...? 

JEIK:
Is that you, Caeda?
Hey, long time no see.
I'm here to meet my beloved Anna. 

SHEEDA:
Huh? Anna lives in a place like this? 

JEIK:
Oh, you didn't know?
Anna's running a secret shop out here. 
It's a tiny bit troublesome coming here,
but y'know, love conquers all barriers! 
Your turn Caeda. What're you doing in
the desert? 

SHEEDA:
Listen, Jake.
We're fighting for the peace of the continent
again. 
Could you help us, like old times...? 

JEIK:
I dunno, I kinda lost my ballista,
so I doubt I'd be much use to you. 

SHEEDA:
That's not true.
You'd help us a lot just by being there... 

JEIK:
Aw, shucks.
How could I say no when you say it like that? 
I bet Anna's worried about the war too.
Alrighty, I'll join you then.

I've wanted to see you for so long.

Huh... Tiki?!
You came to welcome us? 
Oh, I see... you've been living with Lord Gotoh,
haven't you? 
*TIKI leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire, do you know this little girl? 
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Yes. This is Tiki, a companion of ours during
the war. 
Tiki was a great boon to our cause.
She mowed down legions of enemy dragons
with her tremendous power. 
*PLAYER leaves**TIKI enters**MARS leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
What?!
This little girl did that...? 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
But you've certainly grown since last time.
I'm glad to see you're well. 

TIKI:
Yeah... But I was so lonely.
'Cause you never came to see me... 

MARS:
I'm sorry.
But I could never forget about you. 
I had intended to invite you back to Altea
once things had calmed down. 

TIKI:
Mar-Mar...
I... I love you!

What......?!

T-the little girl is now a man! 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Oopsy daisy.
Took you by surprise, didn't I?
Particularly you over there, newbie. 
I'm Xane. A friend of Marth's.
Transformin' into other people's a special
ability of mine. 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hey princey, my Tiki impression was pretty
darn tootin', wasn't it?
Did I provide some comic relief? 
Well, shall we get goin'?
You wanted to see Lord Gotoh, right? 

MARS:
Xane, how do you know Lord Gotoh? 
Just who are you? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well, lemme see.
I don't think that really matters right now. 
Hey, put that jaw back in place and follow me.

MARS:
, I noticed you fighting with that
mask on. 

PLAYER:
Yes. The desert sun was strong,
but it acted as a shield. 
Nevertheless, I suppose there's little point
in wearing it now. 

MARS:
I see.
Are you going to remove it then? 


MS011_ED2_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes.
I think I shall. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, that's probably a good idea. 


MS011_ED2_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
No.
I'll keep fighting with it on. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I-is that so...?
Does it not bother you in any way? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Not at all.
I can fight just fine with it on. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I-I see.
Well, if that's what you've decided then I
have no problems with it.
