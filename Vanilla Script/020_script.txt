MS020_PRE1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we are breaking into the palace! 
Do not forget that Hardin is shielded
by the Darksphere. 
If you are to challenge him,
then you must hold the Lightsphere! 
Ensure, at all costs, that it's given
to the person who will fight Hardin. 


MS020_OP1:
*HARDIN enters**MIDIA enters*
HARDIN:
Midia. That you, a Paladin of Archanea,
would betray your own motherland...
You are a disgrace! 

MIDIA:
Surely you jest!!
Can't you see you're destroying Archanea?
You've gone mad! 
What have you done with Lady Nyna?!
Return our queen at once!! 

HARDIN:
Nyna?
That woman betrayed me. 
All I wanted to do was destroy Grust. 
That woman had the audacity to
give the emblem to that boy...
And so I punished her. 
I will kill all who oppose me.
That includes you, Midia!! 

MIDIA:
Do with my life as you will.
But, Hardin... 
How many people do you think you've
killed out of petty jealousy? 
Enough. Open your eyes! 

HARDIN:
Petty jealousy, you say...?
Heh heh...
Say what you will. 
This world is rotten to its core.
Swarming with insignificant insects
that you call humans. 
What worth is left in it?
Perhaps it would be better if it
were all destroyed. 
Well, Midia, watch carefully.
The boy who pretends to be a prince...
Watch as I snuff out his life!! 


MS020_EV1:
*MARS enters**HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
So, Marth...
My retainer, attacking his liege--
what kind of "honor" is this? 
Altea's so-called Prince of Light
has certainly fallen to the gutters. 

MARS:
Hardin! This isn't you!
Your heart is being controlled
by the Darksphere!! 
Please, you have to snap out of it! 

HARDIN:
Heh heh heh...
Marth, sweet and naive as ever. 
Why do you think I attacked Altea?
Because I utterly despised you. 
In the last war, just because
you were Anri's descendant... 
Nyna entrusted you with the Fire Emblem,
and made you the League's commander. 
"The Prince of Light"...
More like "insolent brat"! 
Without my help,
you would have died long, long ago.
So don't act so high and mighty!! 
I have always despised you since then. 
I put up with you for Nyna's sake,
but I knew we'd have to settle things
sooner or later. 
It has nothing to do with the orb! 

MARS:
Hardin... Is that really how it was...?
I had no idea that...
that you hated me so... 

HARDIN:
Hmph...
That's why you're still just a boy. 
Marth! Come to me.
I'll shove this lance through your heart!! 
There's only enough room in
this continent for one hero,
and that hero is ME! 


MS020_BT_BOSS:
*HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
The rebel army...
Have you come to die?!
Taste the might of the Gradivus!! 


MS020_BT_BOSS_MARS:
*HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
So you've come, Marth!!
I'll run you through, just as you wish! 
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Hardin, that's enough! 


MS020_BT_BOSS_PC_PCF1:
*HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
I've no quarrel with you...
Bring Marth to me!! 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sir Hardin...
To defeat you is my duty.
Prepare yourself.

HARDIN:
I've no quarrel with you...

Dark Emperor Hardin...
Look nowhere else, I am your opponent! 


MS020_DIE_BOSS:
*HARDIN enters**HARDIN leaves**HARDIN3 enters*
HARDIN3:
Prince... Marth... 
I feel as though...
I've finally awoken...
from a long, long nightmare... 
Marth... Forgive me...
I tried to fight the demon inside me. 
...But I wasn't strong enough.
I fought so hard, but...
I just couldn't beat it... 
I wanted to die by your hand...
And now I'm finally saved... 
Marth...
Please... Nyna...
Save Nyna... 
Please...
...Tell her...
Tell her for me... 
Till... till the very end...
I ...loved her... always...
Tell her... to please...forgive me...

Look over there!
Your sister and the others... 

MARS:
Elice! And Princess Nyna...!
Lena, Maria; you're all safe!

GARNEF:
You--you carry the Binding Shield...!
Gah! My magic has been dispelled? 
Withdraw, my priests.
At this rate, he will...
Let us hurry the Shadow Dragon's return!

MARS:
Gharnef...! 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
That man was the Dark Pontifex Gharnef! 
His servants were impersonating
the princesses. 

MARS:
What was he playing at?
He mentioned something about the
Shadow Dragon's return... 
So as we suspected, my sister and the
other clerics must be in Gharnef's hands... 
*PLAYER leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Forgive my interruption, sire,
but Lord Gotoh has arrived. 

MARS:
Lord Gotoh?
Take me straight to him!

MS020_ED1_A_04:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
Excellent work, Prince Marth.
You managed to obtain all of the orbs. 
Thanks to your efforts, the lost
Binding Shield is finally complete. 

MARS:
Incredible!
It felt as though the shield itself
pulled in all the orbs... 
So this is the fabled Binding Shield. 
But what now, Lord Gotoh? 
From Gharnef's actions, it would seem
he has the noble clerics imprisoned. 
I worry for their safety. 

GATO:
Hmm...
I understand how you feel... 
However, we have a far greater task to
accomplish--we must seal away
the earth dragons. 
Soon they will awaken from their slumber. 
They will rise up from the ground,
destroying everything in their wake,
and turn this world into a living hell. 
Go, Marth.
Entomb the awakened dragons once more!

JEIGUN:
, new information regarding
the assassins has reached the palace. 
As you may have guessed, they were
dispatched by Hardin and Gharnef. 
The head of the organization is
a woman named Eremiah. 

PLAYER:
Eremiah...
And where is she now? 

JEIGUN:
Here, in Archanea.
Apparently, she runs an orphanage
in the mountains. 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
An orphanage? 

JEIGUN:
Yes, so it would seem.
However, it's an orphanage in name only. 
She confines the children to a basement
devoid of light, and teaches them all
manner of wicked things....
