*PLAYER enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Macedon's main force consists of
pegasus knights and dracoknights...
Both are fast and highly mobile units. 
In particular, there are the Whitewings, who
fought under our banner in the last war... 
There aren't many in these lands who
could match their terrifying speeds. 

PLAYER:
I would have loved to witness their prowess... 
PLAYER
JEIGUN:
, while we're on the subject of
speed... 


MS002_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your speed can be summed up as exemplary. 
Even the Whitewings would have trouble
keeping up with you.
As I'd expect of an Altean Royal Guard. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It is an honor to receive such praise,
Sir Jagen. 


MS002_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your speed is satisfactory.
But the Whitewings would simply fly straight
over you. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see...
I'll be more careful, Sir Jagen. 


MS002_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your speed is, sadly, terribly lacking.
The Whitewings would probably reach their
destination in half your time.... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I-I see...
I-I'll be more careful, Sir Jagen.

ANNA_HOUSE:
Hello there PLAYER. 

PLAYER:
Hm? You're...? 
Why do I feel like we've met somewhere
before...? 

ANNA_HOUSE:
Oh, don't worry about little old me.
The important thing is that I came here
to share a wonderful tip with you. 
Have you heard about "How's Everyone"? 

PLAYER:
How's... everyone? 

ANNA_HOUSE:
"How's Everyone" is all the rage!
By checking it, you can see how everyone
in your army is faring. 
You can watch your allies train, discover
useful items, or even listen to their thoughts... 
So if you ever want to know how everyone is,
then take a look at "How's Everyone."
Easy, right? 

PLAYER:
I... see. Thanks, I guess. 

ANNA_HOUSE:
The more time passes, the more things you'll
be able to see. 
If you ever feel the urge, then go ahead
take a peek! Well, I'll be off now. Buh-bye! 


MS002_OP1:
*MARS enters**KATUA enters*
KATUA:
Prince Marth!!
Thank goodness you've come to Macedon! 

MARS:
Catria?!
I received word that there was a rebellion
in Macedon. Are you unharmed? 

KATUA:
Yes, I'm fine. My older sister Palla and I
managed to escape somehow. 
But Princess Minerva was captured by
the rebels. 
Prince Marth, please...
You have to rescue Princess Minerva!
At this rate, her life will be in danger! 

MARS:
Of course I will help her.
Catria, please take us to where she is. 

KATUA:
Yes, my lord! 
But first we have to break through these
woods. 
General Rumel's dragon knight squad is
lurking within this area. 
If we approach from the front,
we'll be easy pickings for them. 

MARS:
I see... So you're suggesting we flank them
from the left or the right. 
Thank you, Catria.
Leave it to us! 


MS002_H1:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
Warren's a bit of an idiot.
Just 'cause they payed him well, he went
ahead and joined the rebel army! 
Ahh, to think a fool like him was once
acquainted with the fair Catria... 


MS002_H2:
*LADY enters*
LADY:

Look out for those pilfering thieves.
If they take off with your precious treasure,
you won't ever get it back. 
Never let them escape from your sight. 


MS002_H3:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
Because of the last war, every nation has
been forced to lead hard lives. 
The only well-off country is Archanea,
ruled by Emperor Hardin. 


MS002_H4:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
Some dirty thieves took our village treasure,
the Lady Sword, and ran off with it. 
Only women can wield the incredible power
of that sword. 
Please, prise it back from their filthy hands. 


MS002_H5:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
Beware when dracoknights are around.
Even from a far-off distance, they can
move all at once and swoop down on you! 


MS002_TK1:
*KATUA enters**WOLLEN enters*
KATUA:
Warren?!
Even a good man like you has sided with
the rebel army... 

WOLLEN:
Catria the White, huh?
It's been a while. 
You know I'm just a common hunter.
If they pay me enough, I'll do anything. 

KATUA:
Warren, listen to me! 
Princess Minerva endeavored to create a
country where its people could live at ease. 
She exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute
to accomplish that goal. 
But General Rucke, despite knowing this,
roused the soldiers into a coup d'etat. 
Can't you see? He's just trying to make this
country into his own! 
And you can honestly say you're okay with
that? 

WOLLEN:
...I see.
Well, I don't like the military acting as if they
owned the place... 
Alright then.
If you're going to help the princess,
then so will I. 


MS002_VIL1:
*MARS enters**MAJI enters*
MAJI:
O'er here! Prince Marth! 

MARS:
You're... Cord! 
What are you doing so far from Talys? 

MAJI:
I couldn't sit still when I heard you's
fighting again, so I came to join in. 
We're Talys's mercenaries, right?
If ya died, Princess Caeda'd cry. 
Prince Marth, lemme fight too.
I'll join you's army.

LUMEL:
Taste the terror of Macedon's fearless
dracoknight squad! 


MS002_BT_WOLEN:
*WOLLEN enters*
WOLLEN:
No hard feelings.
I don't have anything against you,
but this is the way I live. Forgive me! 


MS002_DIE_BOSS:
*LUMEL enters*
LUMEL:
General Rucke, I leave the rest to you...

Damn it...
I should've seen this coming...

Sire, we found someone most unusual confined
in one of the fortress rooms. 
*JEIGUN leaves**RINDA enters*
MARS:
Hm? ...Linde!
How did you wind up in a dangerous place
like this? 
*RINDA leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire, do you know this woman? 

MARS:
Yes, this is Linde.
Her natural talent for magic helped us a
great deal in the last war. 
*PLAYER leaves**RINDA enters*
RINDA:
Prince Marth! Thank heavens.
What a pleasant surprise meeting you here. 
I desperately needed to see you again,
so I set out to find you. 
But the Macedonian soldiers found me
suspicious and they dragged me to this
fortress... 

MARS:
Is that so?
I'm glad you're safe.
But, why were you looking for me? 
Shouldn't you be by Princess Nyna's side? 

RINDA:
I was requested by Princess Nyna to deliver
you this.

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh?
This...!
This is the Fire Emblem! 
The royal heirloom of Archanea:
the Emblem Shield! 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
The Fire Emblem...
I heard that in the last war, Princess Nyna
entrusted you with it, sire... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Indeed. I looked after this as Archanea's
representative in the last war.
But why give this to me now? 
Especially at a time when Archanea has so
much influence under Emperor Hardin's reign? 
In this peaceful age, why is Princess Nyna
giving me the "Champion's Proof"...? 
*PLAYER leaves**RINDA enters*
RINDA:
I don't understand either.
Princess Nyna didn't explain why,
just that I had to give it to you... 
I remember her eyes seemed so sad...
I think she may have been crying... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Princess Nyna crying?!
What on earth has been happening...? 
Linde, after this battle ends,
I will go see Princess Nyna. 
Until then, I want you to remain with us. 

RINDA:
Yes, Prince Marth!!
