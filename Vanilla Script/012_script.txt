MARS:
This place... It's incredible...
I feel as though I'm burning up just by
standing here. 

CHEINE:
This is Flame Barrel...
The fire dragons' graveyard. 
It's where the fire dragons who've
degenerated into savage beasts come to
wait for their death. 

MARS:
Degenerated, you say...?
What do you mean by that? 

CHEINE:
I'm not sure if you're aware, but the dragon
tribe is dyin'. 
Those who don't confine their true, dragon
form in a stone eventually lose all reason
and become monsters. 

MARS:
So that's why they become Manaketes? 
Xane, if you know something about the
dragon tribe, please tell me. 

CHEINE:
If you really wanna know... 
Tens of thousands of years ago, the
dragon tribe settled down on this continent,
and created a civilization. 
They possessed intellect and abilities far
exceedin' those of humans. 
But suddenly, outta nowhere, their day of
destruction came. 
At first, they couldn't bear children.
Then they began to lose their minds,
goin' berserk one after the next. 
The elders warned that the end of
dragons as a species was approachin'.
There was no longer any way to prevent it. 
However, there was one way they could
survive: to discard their identities as
dragons and live on as humans. 
The dragons fell into a panic. 
Those who believed the elders sealed their
forms within stones and became humans. 
But those who couldn't throw away their
pride as a dragon; those who adamantly
refused to become human... 
They eventually lost their minds and became
naught but beasts... 

MARS:
Those fire dragons before us... 

CHEINE:
Yeah, they're a livin' example.
And it's not just them.
There are many others. 
But they've all gone feral now.
There's no way for them to go back... 
Worse still, they've been manipulated and
degraded like cattle by the fire clans who
rule over this valley. 
Well, princey.
Whadya say we get out of here? 
The clansmen around here ain't friendly;
if we hang around, we'll end up as bait for
their dragon pets.

MARS:
Darros! What brings you here?!
I thought you had washed your hands of
your pirating days... 

DAROSS:
Prince Marth... Forgive me. 
I was lookin' t'start anew, but there be no
place t'go for an outcast like me... 
To resume and continue these crimes;
'tis dishonorable indeed. 

MARS:
I see...
Darros, you cannot stay here.
Come with us. 

DAROSS:
Prince Marth...
Ye would still accept a fool like me...? 
Prince, I...
This time, I be changin' for sure.
Me life is yours!

*MARS enters**CHEINE enters*
CHEINE:
Phew! And that be the end of the fire
dragons' valley. How you doin', princey? 

MARS:
I'm fine... I think. 
Xane, I believe you said that there were
other feral dragon tribes. 

CHEINE:
Yeah. In addition to this valley, there's the
Wyvern's Dale, the Ice Dragon Shrine and
the Dragon's Altar... 

MARS:
The Dragon's Altar? 

CHEINE:
It's a dragon graveyard in the mountains of
Macedon. There, the earth dragons sleep. 
A long time ago...
Thousands of years ago in fact... 
The mighty earth dragons lost their minds
and attacked the humans. 
'Course, the humans barely stood a chance.
Most were annihilated, and the rest pushed
into the desolate corners of the continent. 
And then... the divine dragon Naga, strongest
of them all, waged a war for humanity. 
It was a fierce battle, but Naga emerged
victorious in the end, and sealed the earth
dragons below Dolhr, in a deep sleep. 
And so that the power of the seal would not
wither, 
she created the "shield of the five orbs"
and placed it in the Fane of Raman. 

MARS:
I see...
I understand now. 
In other words, our guardian deity Naga
depicted in legend was the divine dragon
that saved humanity. 
But then, what about the divine sword
Falchion? 

CHEINE:
Naga took pity on you humans, with no way of
protecting yourselves, so she created it
from one of her fangs. 
Then, together with the shield, she sealed
it in the fane, and had the remainin' dragon
houses watch over humanity. 
She put the newly born Tiki to sleep and thus
ended her 5,000-year life. 
'Cause of all this, Gotoh's tryin' his best to
carry out Naga's order. 

MARS:
Wait, Xane...
Are you telling me...!? 

CHEINE:
Yes: Gotoh is a divine dragon.
And guess what? So am I.

JEIGUN:
Blast... This heat is absurd.
I wasn't sweating this much in the desert... 
I'm usually tolerant of heat, but this is simply
unbearable... 
But PLAYER, you seem... 


MS012_ED2_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You seem... unfazed.
Are you not hot? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I have confidence in my strength. 
Sir Jagen, it seems that our companions are
catching up to us. I'll go and carry them
over here. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
What strength...
It's as though you're invulnerable.
Your reliability is astounding. 


MS012_ED2_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You seem to be struggling too...
Are you holding out alright? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, I've still some strength in me. 
Sir Jagen, it seems that our companions are
catching up to us. I'll go and support them. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Good. I'm depending on you. 


MS012_ED2_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You seem a little dizzy...
Are you holding out alright? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
No...
I-I'm... not doing so well... 
Still...
If I could just use my strength...
Oh no, I feel all weak... 
PLAYER
INSERTNAMEHERE:
, are you well?!
Oomph, how troublesome...
You'd best hold onto me. 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
I-I'm sorry...

*MARS enters**BELF enters*
BELF:
Please pardon my sudden rudeness,
but might you be Prince Marth? 

MARS:
Who are you...? 

BELF:
I am Belf, and these men here are Robert
and Leiden. We rushed here because we wish
to join your battle. 
*BELF leaves**ROBERTO enters*
ROBERTO:
We were once knights of the Sable Order
of Grust, but we have now separated from
our homeland. 
*ROBERTO leaves**LEIDEN enters*
LEIDEN:
We threw away our ranks as knights, and
now live to protect those who are powerless. 

MARS:
The Sable Order of Grust... 
But in the previous war, we fought against
the Sable Order as enemies. 
Despite that, you're willing to join our army? 
*LEIDEN leaves**BELF enters*
BELF:
Our general wished for us to protect the
weak, regardless of nationality. 
He is gone now, so we would like to fulfill his
final wish. 

MARS:
............ 
I see.
You seem to speak truly.
Very well. I'd like you to fight alongside us.
