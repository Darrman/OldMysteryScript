*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
So this is the Ice Dragon Shrine.
The final destination of Anri's treacherous
journey... 


MS014_OP2:
*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
Prince Marth, can you hear me?
Come to the front of the center room.
I shall await you there. 


MS014_EV1:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
You have done well to make it this far,
Prince Marth! Anri's blood truly flows within
you. 
To reward your courage, I entrust you with
the Lightsphere. 
This will nullify the Darksphere's power.
Defeating Hardin will no longer be an
impossible task. 
And what of the star shards? 


MS014_EV2_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
What?!
You've collected them all! 
Goodness gracious.
With these, I can restore the Starsphere.
Wait one moment... 
*GATO enters*
GATO:
Marth.
This is the Starsphere.
I entrust this to you also. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh?
Lord Gotoh, why would you give me something
so precious? 

GATO:
Only you can restore the Binding Shield...
The shield has chosen you. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Excuse me...? 


MS014_EV2_A2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Are you still in the dark?
The emblem shield you carry is the
Binding Shield that was once stolen... 
Archanea's Fire Emblem. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You mean...!
This Fire Emblem is the Binding Shield... 
Lord Gotoh, does that mean...
If I were to place all five orb into this,
the Binding Shield will be restored? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You are indeed correct...
But 600 years have passed since it broke... 
The earth dragons sealed under Macedon
will soon awaken. 
There are several hundreds--no, several
thousands. 
I will entrust Tiki to you as well.
You will find her in the room to the right.
With her, you can defeat those dragons. 
But I must warn you.
If you do not complete the Binding Shield,
even Tiki will be destroyed. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
What?!
But why!? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Because she is still a child.
Without the shield, she too will degenerate.. 
In time, she will turn into a beast and attack
humanity. 
I took pity on her and sent her to sleep. 
But if the Binding Shield is restored,
we will no longer have to worry.
The shield will protect Tiki. 
Marth, I leave Tiki in your hands.
Please free her from her destruction. 


MS014_EV2_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see.
You couldn't collect them all... 
I suppose it couldn't be helped...
Nevertheless, I will take what shards you
have. 
Tiki is sleeping in the room to the right,
but since the shield has not been restored,
I cannot let you meet her. 
She has yet to mature into an adult.
Without the Binding Shield, her degeneration
is but inevitable. 
In time, she will turn into a beast and attack
humanity. 
I'm afraid Tiki cannot ever be allowed to
awaken again. 'Tis for her own good... 
Marth, if you have taken the treasures,
then head to the room to the left.
I shall await you there... 


MS014_EV3:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Tiki?!
Are you alright? 
*TIKI enters*
TIKI:
Yeah... 
...Mar...
Mar-Mar... 
Oh, Mar-Mar!!
You came!
You came to see Tiki!! 

MARS:
That's right, Tiki.
It's been a while.
Have you been well? 

TIKI:
Uhh... not really.
Lord Gotoh said that I had to sleep again. 
But... I don't wanna.
I slept all by myself for a really long time. 
I had so many scary dreams, over and over. 
I dreamt I ended up like the poor fire dragons
and ice dragons... That I was a terrifying
monster. 
I'd attack humans and kill them. 
"No...", "Stop..." they'd shout, and then I'd
wake up. All alone, in this pitch black room... 
I cried so much. 
And each time, Ban-Ban comforted me. 
Then, one day he took me out, and brought
me to a human village. 
The village life was so fun!
Everyone treated me so nice...
I was really happy. 
I don't wanna sleep anymore...
Next time I close my eyes, I feel as though
I'll never open them again. 
I don't want that.
I want to live with everyone.
I don't want to sleep. 

MARS:
Tiki, it's alright now.
I'll protect you.
So don't cry anymore... 

TIKI:
Really...? I don't have to see those terrible
dreams anymore?! 

MARS:
Oh, of course! 
Once the Binding Shield is restored, you can
come live with us. Tiki, trust me, and come
with me! 

TIKI:
Yeah! Yaaay!!
Thank you, Mar-Mar! 


MS014_EV4:
*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
It cannot be someone else.
Prince Marth himself needs to come here. 


MS014_EV5:
*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
I'm sorry, but I cannot let you see Tiki.
It's for her own good... 


MS014_BT_TIKI:
*TIKI enters*
TIKI:
Huh...?
Who... who are you...? 


MS014_DIE_TIKI:
*TIKI enters*
TIKI:
...Ah...
Mar...Mar... 


MS014_ED1_A:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
I see...
So Tiki was pretty happy.
It must have been very painful for her. 
Though it was to protect her, I was far too
cruel to her. I suspect she must really hate
me... 
You should go, Marth.
I will send you to Altea with my powers. 



MS014_ED1_B:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
You should go, Marth.
I will send you to Altea with my powers. 



MS014_ED2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gotoh, why don't you come with us? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hmm...
At the moment I've one thing I must still
investigate. 
Gharnef has returned. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Gharnef...!?
But we killed him! 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, you killed his body. 
But his soul was held prisoner by the
Darksphere, and within it, his hatred only
grew. 
Afterwards, his former disciples--the heretic
bishops--resurrected him. 
And they seem to be planning something foul. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see.
Very well, Lord Gotoh.
We shall split ways here. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Indeed.
If I find something, then I too will visit Altea
afterwards. 
I'm counting on you, Marth.
Everything rests on your shoulders. 
You must save both our races from the path
of destruction. 


MS014_ED3_PCF1:
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
...Altea, home at last.
Though you may be occupied by Archanea...
I will get you back, I swear. 


MS014_ED3_PCM1:
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
...At long last, Altea.
My dearest home... 
Archanean occupation be damned;
I will get you back, I swear it! 


MS014_ED3_0_PCF1:
*CHEINE enters*
CHEINE:
Boy, what a serious lady. 
Hey, PLAYER.
You said you're Marth's Royal Guard, right? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes.
My mission is to protect Prince Marth. 

CHEINE:
I see. 
But if you really plan on protectin' him,
then you need the strength to match your
conviction. 
Hey, do you wanna know a way to get
stronger? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hm?
You know of a way? 


MS014_ED3_0_PCM1:
*CHEINE enters*
CHEINE:
Boy, what a serious fella. 
Hey, PLAYER.
You said you're Marth's Royal Guard, right? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes.
My mission is to protect Prince Marth at all
costs. 

CHEINE:
I see. 
But if you really plan on protectin' him,
then you're gonna need the strength to
back up your conviction. 
Hey, do you wanna know a way to get
stronger? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh?
Do you know how to? 


MS014_ED3_1:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
'Course, just hold on a second. 
*TIKI enters*
TIKI:
Ta-da!
PLAYER, you know about Tiki, right? 
Tiki's still a kid, but the real reason she can
fight is because of her hairstyle and tiara. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Wait, what?!
Are you serious?! 

TIKI:
Yeah, if you wear your hair like this,
then you'll be that much stronger. 
So all you gotta do is wear this tiara,
and wear your hair like Tiki. 
If you do that, then a legendary power
will flow through you! ...Well, maybe. 
So?
Do you wanna give it a try? 


MS014_ED3_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Sure, why not? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Alrighty then.
I'll be sure to do this properly. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Thank you, Sir Xane! 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
......You aren't doubting me?
Is this trust or naivete...? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Is something the matter, Sir Xane? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Ah, no, it's nothin'.
Well, see you around.
I'm looking forward to your new look! 


MS014_ED3_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
No, that's quite alright.
I want to protect Prince Marth with my own
strength. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hmm, that so?
Boring. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh?
What do you mean "boring"? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Ah, no, it's nothin'.
Catch you later!
