*MARS enters**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire, am I glad to see you! 
PLAYER
MARS:
!
Thank goodness.
Is everyone else okay? 

PLAYER:
Yes, everyone who survived is here. 

MARS:
Amazing. I don't know how you all managed
to escape that onslaught... 


MS009_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
We were most fortunate.
A sandstorm was brewing as we were
making our escape... 
Thanks to the obscuring sands, the enemy
lost sight of us, and we were able to
escape with ease. 
Even during normal battles,
I seem to have lucky moments like that. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see.
PLAYER, you must be loved by the goddess
of fortune. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It would be my honor. 


MS009_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your thoughts are mine.
But somehow we were able to shake off the
enemy and escape. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see.
Thank you, PLAYER. 


MS009_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Me neither.
The way was blocked by earth and sand,
and we lost our way as well... 
B-but somehow...
Somehow we escaped. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
How horrible for you...
Even during normal battles, PLAYER,
unlucky things always seem to befall you. 
I have to wonder if the goddess of fortune
hates you? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It would certainly seem that way... 


MS009_OP1:
*MINERBA enters**MISHEIL enters*
MISHEIL:
Minerva, if you wait in this village,
you will most certainly run into Marth. 
I don't like him, but he is indeed noble.
Join forces with him. 

MINERBA:
Brother, what are you going to do now?
Won't you come with me...? 

MISHEIL:
I have no intention of doing that.
I only wish to find Maria and bring her home
to Macedon. 

MINERBA:
You've changed, Brother...
Or should I say, you've returned to how you
used to be. 
As I thought, back then you were being
controlled by Gharnef's dark magic. 

MISHEIL:
No, no magic could bend my will. 
I wished to crush the arrogant Archanea,
and establish Macedonian supremacy over
this continent. 
But Father, without bending his ear to me,
distanced himself from me and later had me
banished. 

MINERBA:
Are you saying that's why you murdered
Father? 
What a fool you were...
Didn't you realize that was Gharnef's
plotting all along? 
Yes, Father was strict with you. 
But it was only because he loved you.
Why couldn't you see that? 

MISHEIL:
Enough, Minerva.
Do you take me for a fool? 
After I was defeated, I wandered the gap
between life and death. 
When I had come to, in front of me,
I saw Maria--her eyes full of tears--
praying to the gods. 
While I treated her like a pawn,
Maria, she shed tears for me... 
Minerva, I'm going now.
I have to save Maria.
At least that can be my atonement! 

MINERBA:
Michalis... 


MS009_OP2_PCF1:
*MARS enters**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire.
How shall we proceed from here? 

MARS:
Hmm... I want to go home to Altea,
but if we can't prevail against Hardin,
then we can't go back. 
What in the world are we supposed to do...? 

PLAYER:
We need to find out the secret of the
strange power that's protecting Hardin. 
Forgive me, sire.
As your Royal Guard, I was supposed to
strike down your foes... 

MARS:
No, it's not your fault, PLAYER.
I too felt a strange presence emanating
from Hardin, almost like... 
*PLAYER leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, it's an emergency!
I have just come into some new information. 
The Khadein mage corps has launched an
offensive against us. 

MARS:
What!?
Even Khadein means to be our enemy...
Merric, what are you... 
*MARS leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sir Jagen, what should we do? 

JEIGUN:
At this rate, it seems we have no choice. 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we need to break into the sanctuary,
but you must be prepared to make sacrifices. 
If we don't hurry, Archanea's pursuit force
will reach our rear and we'll be trapped. 

MARS:
I understand. We've no choice. 
Everyone, let's break into the sanctuary!
But avoid needless fights if possible!

MS009_EV1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
An update, sire!
The Archanea army is, at present,
approaching from the south. 

MARS:
I see.
Hasten the march;
don't let them catch up! 


MS009_EV2A:
*ASTRIA enters*
ASTRIA:
Do not think you can escape, Alteans.
I'll turn this desert into your graveyard. 


MS009_EV2B:
*SOLDIER_RED enters*
SOLDIER_RED:
Do not think you can escape, Alteans.
We will avenge Captain Astram! 


MS009_H1:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
From here on north, you won't see no more
shops. 
If you're going that way, you should stock
up now. 


MS009_H2:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
A swordslayer will demonstrate your might
against a mercenary or a hero. 
You should definitely get one if you can. 


MS009_H3:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
The person commanding Khadein's mage
corps is a young man named Elrean. 
He's not a bad man, but he can be a bit
uncooperative. 
Seems he regards his old rival, Merric,
with disdain. 
Hmm...
I reckon only Lord Wendell could talk some
sense into him. 


MS009_TK1:
*MARS enters**ETZEL enters*
MARS:
You're... Etzel!
Why are you here? 

ETZEL:
I have my ties to Khadein as well. 
"Prince Marth has succumbed to his
ambitions and invaded Archanea." 
When I was told that, there was no way I
could sit still! 

MARS:
...... 

ETZEL:
But... No matter how I put it, I just couldn't
imagine you'd become that sort of person. 
Prince Marth, you said to me long ago that
you wanted to let the era of war end. 
Do you still stand by those words? 

MARS:
Yes, I do.
I do not seek to fight. 

ETZEL:
...I see.
I, too, do not seek as such.
Allow me to join you once more. 


MS009_VIL1:
*MARS enters**MINERBA enters*
MARS:
Huh?
Princess Minerva, why are you here? 

MINERBA:
My brother... Michalis, he helped me. 

MARS:
Really? That's good to hear.
I was so worried once I heard that
Prince Michalis had taken you. 
But, for him to rescue you:
what in the world happened? 

MINERBA:
Maria saved Michalis's life. 
She's kind, unlike myself... 
Maria's kindness was able to touch the
heart of even a man like Michalis. 

MARS:
But, isn't that what you wanted?
That's why you deliberately avoided killing
Michalis. 
Am I wrong, Princess? 

MINERBA:
Hmm...... 

MARS:
I can understand.
No one can sever the ties between family
so easily. 
Princess, please lift your spirits.
I would like you to fight with us again,
just like before. 
I would like Macedon's strength and yours
in order to put a stop to Hardin's designs. 


MS009_BT_ASTRIA:

ASTRIA:
You traitors!
I'll show you the might of Mercurius!!

YODEL:
I will not forgive intruders upon our
holy sanctuary!
Earth, show your fury! Bolganone!! 


MS009_BT_ETZEL:
*ETZEL enters*
ETZEL:
I don't want to fight you, but I owe Khadein.
What a troublesome ordeal I am in... 


MS009_DIE_ASTRIA:
*ASTRIA enters*
ASTRIA:
Midia... My love... 


MS009_DIE_BOSS:
*YODEL enters*
YODEL:
Elrean...
Was this really what you wanted...? 


MS009_DIE_ETZEL:
*ETZEL enters*
ETZEL:
This war... will... someday...

MARS:
, Merric's inside there.
You met him during your training, right? 

PLAYER:
Yes.
Sir Merric really helped us with his magical
prowess. 
So Sir Merric is here...
We must hurry, sire. 

MARS:
Yes, let's go!
