*PLAYER enters**MARS enters*
MARS:
...... 
That's, uh, certainly one heck of a hat...
A gift from Ymir, I presume? 

PLAYER:
Yes. It keeps me warm.
Although I'm worried that it'll stand out... 

MARS:
I should be, if I were you.
If you stepped out on the battlefield
wearing that, you'd be a popular target... 


MS022_OP1:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
Prince Marth, in this altar lurks many
savage barbarians and mage dragons
long gone mad. 
They have fallen under Gharnef's spell
and will attack you given the chance. 
Gharnef's servants--
the heretic priests possess great power.
They are not to be taken lightly. 
If you let this battle drag on,
it may become fiercer than you can handle.
Do not stop. Make for the end at once! 
Once you defeat Gharnef, retrieve the
Falchion that he stole from your Altea. 
As you well know, without the Falchion,
defeating Medeus will be nigh impossible... 

MARS:
I understand, Lord Gotoh. 
My friends and I shall sally forth
to the deepest depths of the altar! 

GATO:
It would be wise to bring this ally with you.
She has deigned to lend you her strength.

You're... 
*MARS leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Another ally from the previous war, sire? 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
No, I don't believe we've ever met.
But, why...?
I have the strangest feeling that I know her... 

NAGA:
My name... is Nagi.
I will... stop the enemy...
You must hurry to the throne room... 
Go...
This time... everything...
must end......

MS022_ED1_PCF1:
*MARS enters**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire,
there are stairs leading further in.
This way, if you please. 


MS022_ED1_PCM1:
*MARS enters**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire!
Look, stairs!
They probably lead further in. 


MS022_ED2:
*PLAYER enters**MARS enters*
PLAYER:
We must hurry, sire! 

MARS:
Right, PLAYER! 
...By the way, do you intend to
wear that hat from here on out? 

PLAYER:
Actually, I'm not entirely sure.
It's very warm, as Sir Ymir said,
but I stick out like a sore thumb... 

MARS:
Indeed, the enemies looked surprised.
Well, what is your decision?
Are you going to take it off? 


MS022_ED2_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, I think I will remove it for this battle. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Excellent choice. Well, let's hurry! 


MS022_ED2_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
No, I rather like it. It's so toasty. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I-I see. Well then, let's go!
