MARS:
, may I have a moment? 
Wh-what in the blazes!?
M-may I ask, what happened to your hair? 

PLAYER:
Father Wrys cut my hair for me.
Is something wrong, sire? 

MARS:
He, uh, certainly did. 
Well, if you like it, then wonderful. 
......
W-well then, let's begin the war council. 

PLAYER:
Yes, sire. 


MS004_OP1:
*OGUMA enters**YUMINA enters*
OGUMA:
Yumina, Yubello. 
This place is notorious for the Macedonian
Vikings. 
If we could, we'd stay the hell away,
but the village where Lord Wendell resides
is just past this area. 
*YUMINA leaves**YUBELLO enters*
YUBELLO:
Mister Ogma...
I'm scared...
Can we go back...? 
*OGUMA leaves**YUMINA enters*
YUMINA:
Yubello! Get a hold of yourself!
You're a man, are you not?
Show some spine! 
You can use a Fire tome, can't you?
So... fight with it! 

YUBELLO:
But Master Wendell said that we mustn't
fight... Besides, I don't like fighting. 

YUMINA:
Ugh, stop complaining!
It's just you and me now. 
You have to stay strong, because I... sniff...
I don't know what we're supposed to do... 

YUBELLO:
Oh... I'm sorry, Yumina...
I'll do my best, so... please don't cry! 
*YUMINA leaves**OGUMA enters*
OGUMA:
Damn... This can't be good...
We've been spotted. 
Kids, we've got no choice;
we're going to have to cut through.
Do not leave my side! 


MS004_EV1:
*GAIL enters*
GAIL:
Gahahaha! 
Won't be long now 'til my boys, hidden
in the forts, all spring out 'n' attack. 
I can almost see the precious looks on their
bewildered faces! 


MS004_H1:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
These days, all them bandits and pirates've
been doin' as they please.
Geez. 
This wouldn't 'ave 'appened if it weren't for
all them political tomfoolery. 


MS004_H2:
*GIRL enters*
GIRL:
Oh, those "Star Shards" are so shiny and
pretty. If you hold on to them, something
good might happen to you. 


MS004_H3:
*BOY enters*
BOY:
D'you know of a staff called Rescue? 
I hear you can bring faraway allies right
next to you in a flash!
It'd be so cool if it were true! 


MS004_TK1:
*SIRIUS enters**OGUMA enters*
OGUMA:
And just who the hell are you?
Are you in league with the pirates? 

SIRIUS:
I am Sirius, a mere traveler. 

OGUMA:
Oh, I see.
I'm a little bit worked up right now.
Sorry about the mix-up. 

SIRIUS:
Those children... 

OGUMA:
I'm taking care of them.
Do you know them? 



MS004_TK1_01:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
No, I don't...
But I do know that, as things stand,
you won't escape with them. 
As I understand it, the Altean army should
arrive here, provided you reach the
southern village. 
Please, allow me to distract the bandits,
while you make your escape to safety. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see. So Prince Marth is here, eh?
Got it, thanks. 
I've got to ask though. 
Why help a group of complete strangers like
us? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I want to save the children.
That is... all. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see... 
Sirius... You said your name was Sirius, right?
Let's meet again after we both get out of
here! 
There's someone I need to take care of...
The guy in charge of Grust's occupation,
Commander Lang. 
I want to avenge a man named Lorenz... 
You--join me...!
If I've got you on my side, then I'll be that
much stronger. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes...
That would be interesting. 
But first, you have to survive.
Hurry and go!

*KASHIM enters**MARS enters*
MARS:
Well, if it isn't Castor!
What brings you to a place like this? 

KASHIM:
Ah, Prince Marth! 
Erm...
Actually, I need money for medicine for me
sick mother. 
But I couldn't find any work in Talys,
so I moved here instead. 

MARS:
I see... That's terrible...
I do hope your mother gets better. 
Well, goodbye then... 

KASHIM:
......... 
Wait!!
Me mother, she's really sick...
I need money, sir... 
*MARS leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
Hm? Oh right, here.
It's only a little, but I hope it helps. 

KASHIM:
Uhm... Thank you, Prince Marth. 
You don't have to be so kind to a guy like me... 

MARS:
Castor... That's a bit much... 
It's only natural to help someone in need. 

KASHIM:
No, Prince Marth!
You've done so much for me. 
I want to help you.
Please, let me fight alongside you. 
You have me life at your disposal!! 


MS004_VIL2:
*UNCLE enters**MARS enters*
UNCLE:
Oh, you're... you're... the prince of Altea!
How nice of you to drop by, sir! 

MARS:
I heard Lord Wendell was living here. 

UNCLE:
Yes, that, er... was correct... 
Yesterday, a group of Archanean soldiers
suddenly came and took the pontifex away. 
Although, Prince...
He did leave this magic tome behind. 
I believe it's wind magic.
Please, take it with you. 


MS004_BT_GAIL:
*GAIL enters*
GAIL:
I'm sorry!
...I wasn't thinking! 
Gahaha, just kidding!
I'll be smashing your pretty head in!!!

SIRIUS:
Touch me and I'll strike you down. 


MS004_DIE_GAIL:

How foolish of me...

*MARS enters**SHEEDA enters*
SHEEDA:
Marth!! 

MARS:
Caeda?
Did something happen?
Why are you here? 

SHEEDA:
Marth...
Altea... Altea was attacked by the imperial
army. 
The Archanean League... Gra and Aurelis
ambushed us. Our forces were annihilated
and we lost the castle... 

MARS:
Wh-what did you say?!
This can't be happening!
Altea is... 
*SHEEDA leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Damn!
Our homeland has fallen to the enemy... 
*PLAYER leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
This is terrible beyond words...
That which I feared the most has come to
pass. 
Emperor Hardin likely heard Lang's story, 
and had us branded traitors. 

MARS:
I refuse to believe it.
Hardin would never attack Altea! 
You're telling me that he believed Lang and
truly thought that I wished to instigate a
rebellion? Never! 

JEIGUN:
No, I agree with you, sire.
This attack was too soon.
It happened far too quickly. 
For an attack of this scale, a great number
of preparations had to have been in place. 
It is likely... that the Grust campaign was a
setup. As was the situation in Macedon. 
It's quite simple, really.
They had you leave Altea, with your elite
knights in tow, 
and then proceeded to attack our weakened
defenses. 
Hardin had this planned right from the start. 

MARS:
That's preposterous! 
Are you implying that Hardin--
with no provocation whatsoever--
decided to attack his fellow nation? 
Are you seriously suggesting this was all an
elaborate trap? 
No!
I won't accept it...
Hardin... why? 
*JEIGUN leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire... 
*MARS leaves**SHEEDA enters*
JEIGUN:
Princess Caeda, what of the others?
Is Princess Elice safe? 

SHEEDA:
Elice, she...
She gave herself up in order to let me
escape with this message. 
Marth... I'm so sorry.
She wanted me to warn you, no matter what...
Sniff... 
*JEIGUN leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
Caeda... Don't cry. I understand.
Just knowing you're safe makes me happy. 
I should be the one apologizing.
I shouldn't have left... 
You needn't have to go through this. 
We will take back Altea. 
Even if we have to fight Hardin, we WILL
reclaim our homeland!

*JEIGUN enters**PLAYER enters*
JEIGUN:
Oh, by the way, PLAYER.
About that hairstyle of yours... 
Have you deciced to keep it that way? 

PLAYER:
...Do you think it looks funny? 
Well, it'll grow back eventually, if I leave it
alone... Do you think I should return it to
normal? 

JEIGUN:
Well, it's your decision to make.
You should do as you please. 
So what will it be?
Are you going to go back to the hairstyle
you had before? 


MS004_ED2_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yeah. I'll have to apologize to Father Wrys
later, but I think I'll change it back to normal. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes.
I do believe that would be a good idea. 


MS004_ED2_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
No, it's alright.
I'm quite fond of my new hair...
Or lack of it, rather. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I-is that so?
Well, if that's your wish, then I can hardly
complain.
