MS003_OP0_01:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hah! Hyah! 
*JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
I see you train without the need for sleep.
Most admirable, PLAYER. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Ah, Sir Jagen. 

JEIGUN:
A strong offense and a tough defense
are obviously important, but...
You cannot afford to neglect your skill. 
Without the skill to deliver it, it matters not
how mighty your attack is if it does not
reach the enemy. 
Speaking of which... 


MS003_OP0_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your skill is like that of an expert...
I have nothing to add.
Keep up the good work. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Thank you, Sir Jagen. 


MS003_OP0_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your skill is not bad.
Don't fall behind the other knights. 
The experience you gain from training and
combat, will help elevate your skill further.
Be ever diligent. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, Sir Jagen. 


MS003_OP0_C:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Your skill is still insufficient...
It ought to be better than this. 
You may or may not have the talent for it,
but don't give up... 
The more experience you gain from training
and combat, the more you can refine your
skill. Be ever diligent. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Y-yes, Sir Jagen. 


MS003_OP1:
*JURIAN enters**PAORA enters*
PAORA:
Julian, good news!
Catria finally brought the Altean army for us! 
We're going to join their ranks to help save
Princess Minerva. 
Please take Lena and escape to safety,
quickly! 

JURIAN:
No can do, Palla.
Lena's disappeared...
I'm not leaving by myself. 

PAORA:
What? Lena as well...
Princess Maria is missing too;
why is it only clerics...? 

JURIAN:
Anyway, I'm staying in the village to see if I
can't find any information. 
Sorry, Palla.
Give my best to Prince Marth. 


MS003_EV1:
*RYUKE enters**MISHEIL enters*
MISHEIL:
Rucke, I'm impressed a spineless coward like
you could throw this country into so much
chaos. 
I'll hazard a guess that Hardin talked you
into this? 

RYUKE:
Wha-! ...Y-you're...
B-but how... 

MISHEIL:
Thought I was dead?
Haha... My death was but a trifle. 
Hand Minerva over to me, Rucke. 
I no longer have plans for this country.
Do with it as you please. 
However, I won't rest until I've disposed of
"him" with my own hands. 

RYUKE:
U-uhh... but, Princess Minerva is barely
breathing... Nobody could save her now... 

MISHEIL:
Do you want me to shove this spear down
your throat? I said bring her to me. 

RYUKE:
Y-yes, of course.
S-somebody, bring the princess here! 


MS003_EV1_02:
*MISHEIL enters**Y_MINERBA enters*
MISHEIL:
It's been a while, Minerva.
That ungainly appearance doesn't suit you. 
Losing Maria;
your subordinates abandoning you...
Is this the ideal country you dreamed of? 

Y_MINERBA:
Mi... Michalis...
How...? 


MS003_VIL1:
*MARS enters**JURIAN enters*
JURIAN:
Hey Prince, it's been a while, hasn't it?
It's me, Julian! 

MARS:
Julian? 
I'd heard that you'd gone to Macedon with
Lena, but to think we'd cross paths here... 
How is Lena?
Of course, she's with you, right? 

JURIAN:
Well, er, how should I say this...
Lena suddenly up and vanished...
I... I don't know what to do. 

MARS:
Wait, Julian, tell me what happened, in detail. 

JURIAN:
Lena's been missing since last night. 
The villagers speak of some sort of strange
priest prowling around lately. 
It seems that somehow, Lena was taken by
this man. 

MARS:
A priest...? 
Julian, as it turns out, Princess Maria has
gone missing as well.
I have a terrible feeling about this. 
Anyway, staying here won't solve anything.
Come with us. 
I'm worried for Lena too.
We'll all help to look for her. 

JURIAN:
Prince Marth... Thank you.
Nothing would please me more. 


MS003_VIL2:
*SAJI enters**MARS enters*
MARS:
You, you're Bord!
You've came to Macedon as well? 

SAJI:
Long time no see, Prince.
Cord already joined with you's guys, right? 
We Talysian mercenaries wanted to join
you's army, so we came all the way here. 
Princess Caeda's our lady, and the guy who's
gonna be her man is important to us too. 
Prince Marth, I'll protect you with my life. 


MS003_VIL3:
*WOMAN2 enters*
WOMAN2:
Have you noticed that large drawbridge
behind this village? 
Normally it's separated by the river, but if
you use this key here, you can cross the
bridge. 
Just, once you cross the drawbridge, the
enemies on the other side will come and
attack you at once. 
If you want to advance safely,
you might be better off taking the long 
detour that goes right around the mountain.
 
Here, take the key.
No matter which path you take,
do take care of yourself, m'kay? 


MS003_H1:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
The pegasus knight trio must be lonely
without Est. 
And I was such a fan of their
"Triangle Attack!" too... 
Oh, Est...
Come home already, will ya? 


MS003_H2:
*WOMAN1 enters*
WOMAN1:
You know, a little while ago, a paladin came
here; said he was on a journey. 
He was wearing a mask, but I'm sure that
underneath, he was a good person. 
He was kind, yet wrapped in a veil of sorrow.
I wonder if I'll ever see him again... 


MS003_H3:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
This is just between you and me, but I heard
that armory is in league with the rebels. 
If you're going to enter you should be careful
not to get jumped. 


MS003_H4:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
I wonder what's going to happen to Macedon? 
They say that Prince Michalis is dead, and
Princess Maria is nowhere to be found... 
On top of that, they say that Princess
Minerva has been captured and that her
life is in peril. 
I just hope... that this country doesn't end
up like Grust... 


MS003_TK1:
*JURIAN enters**MATIS enters*
JURIAN:
Hey! Cut it out.
Why must you always insist on pointing your
sword at us? 
I pity Lena for having to put up your
stupidity. 

MATIS:
Oh, it's you, Julian.
Are you still trying to worm your way into
Lena's good books? 
No way, I won't hand my cute lil' sister to a
thieving rat like you. 

JURIAN:
You can relax...
Lena and I would never work out. 
But even if it's just a little,
I wanted to help her in any way I could. 

MATIS:
Ooh, you finally realized where you stand.
Attaboy, Julian! 

JURIAN:
Er, that's not the kind of thing I want to be
hearing from you... 
Well, whatever.
If you're worried about Lena, then come
with me. 

MATIS:
Oh, alright, thanks. 
You see, they forced me to join the rebel
army, but you know I hate fighting. 
Alright, lil' brother.
Let's join forces and look for our cute lil'
Lena! 


MS003_BT_MATIS:
*MATIS enters*
MATIS:
Lena... Where are you?
What I would give to hear your voice just
once before I die... 


MS003_BT_RYUKE:
*RYUKE enters*
RYUKE:
D-damn it...
Why is the Altean army here...?
You're all going down with me. Die! 


MS003_DIE_MATIS:
*MATIS enters*
MATIS:
Lena...
F-forgive... your foolish big brother... 


MS003_DIE_RYUKE:
*RYUKE enters*
RYUKE:
The Altean knights...
As I expected... 


MS003_ED1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, the rebels have fled the castle,
but I regret to inform you that Princess
Minerva was nowhere to be found. 

MARS:
What could have happened?
She was supposed to be held inside the
castle... 


MS003_ED2_PCF1:
*MARS enters**RANG enters*
RANG:
Oh-hoh, I knew this task was unworthy.
Excellent work, Prince Marth. 
We'll take care of Macedon from here.
Now, let us discuss your next mission. 

MARS:
General Lang, what in the world do you want
this time? 

RANG:

Well, you see... My castle was attacked and
the Grustian prince and princess were
kidnapped. 
The perpetrator fled to Macedon, it seems.
Prince Marth, you are to capture him and
return the children to me! 

MARS:
You're asking me to send those children to
their doom! 

RANG:
You're in no position to defy me.
Now, off to work you go, my prince. 
*MARS leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
You...!
Your rudeness towards my liege has gone
too far...! 
Shut up!
Prince Marth is not your minion! 

RANG:
What did you say?!
Know your place, Altean soldier! 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
RANG:
Marth, it seems that your countrymen are
devoid of manners! 

MARS:
...I apologize on her behalf. 
But it is as PLAYER says:
General Lang, I will no longer follow your
orders from here. 



MS003_ED2_PCM1:

You'd do wise to continue slaving for my
benefit, Prince Marth.

You...!
Your rudeness towards my liege has gone
too far...! 
Shut up!
Prince Marth is not your minion!

MS003_ED2_02_PCF1:
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire...! 
*PLAYER leaves**RANG enters*
RANG:
What! Do you mean to defy my orders?! 
I see... I see.
As I suspected, it was YOUR doing. 
The person who kidnapped Grust's prince
and princess was the mercenary, Ogma.
On your orders, no less! 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I didn't know of this.
But if I had the choice, I would have done
exactly as you suggested. 
Back at Grust, even though they were meant
to be our enemies, I should have helped
those children. 

RANG:
You!
You clearly speak words of treason! 
Perhaps I should report this to the Emperor! 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Do as you will.
But you're not the only person who intends
to visit the palace. 
I will speak to Emperor Hardin and Princess
Nyna and inform them of your crimes. 
Forgive me, Jagen.
But I cannot stand for this any longer. 
*JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
I understand.
You have endured well until now. 
Lang, my liege might forgive your frequent
rudeness to him, but I will not. 
Come, draw your sword.
Even though I, Jagen, am old and senile,
I will not lose to the likes of you. 

RANG:
Wh... what did you say?!
Damn you... I'll remember this!! 
Once the Emperor gets wind of this, I'll crush
your puny little Altea!

MS003_ED3_PCF1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
Jagen... you're a bag of surprises.
To think you'd stand up against Lang like
that. 

JEIGUN:
Sire, are you underestimating me in my old
age? 
Bwahaha...
I'm not about to let youngsters like
PLAYER hog all the glory just yet. 
Still, I'll admit it was somewhat foolish
to contest with Lang, even if he did
push my lord at every turn. 
*JEIGUN leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire, Sir Jagen.
What is our next plan of action? 

MARS:
According to Lang, Ogma is on his way to
Macedon. 
He probably intends to visit the village where
Lord Wendell resides. 

PLAYER:
Lord Wendell? 

MARS:
Lord Wendell is a pontifex of Khadein;
he fought as our ally in the last war.
I hear he's living in Macedon now. 
It also happens that the children that
Ogma saved were raised by Lord Wendell. 
So I'm sure it would be the perfect time to
pay him a visit. 

PLAYER:
Yes, understood. 
*PLAYER leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
But, I worry about Lang...
I pray that nothing bad shall happen... 


MS003_ED3_PCM1:

*PLAYER enters**JEIGUN enters*PLAYER
JEIGUN:
, are you aware that we've been
searching for the assassins who besieged
Altea a year ago...? 

PLAYER:
Ah!
I assume, since you're mentioning it,
that you've found a new lead? 

JEIGUN:
We're not certain, but we've received
information that might lead us to them. 
A few days ago, I heard of a suspicious
group heading towards Macedon's northern
mountains. 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
The northern mountains?
What could they be after up there? 

JEIGUN:
Rumors say they are pursuing our former
allies in the War of Shadows... 
And I don't believe they're after a friendly
chat with them either. 

MARS:
I see. Then we cannot ignore this lead,
especially if lives are at stake. 


MS003_ED4_Y:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Jagen, PLAYER, we shall pursue the enemy. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Agreed.
Let us prepare to march, with haste.
