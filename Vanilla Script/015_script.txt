MS015_OP0:
*PLAYER enters**MARS enters*
PLAYER:
Sire, the war council will begin soon. 

MARS:
Thank you, PLAYER... Huh?
Wh-what happened to your hair...? 

PLAYER:
Sir Xane did it for me. 
He said that a legendary power
would enter me if I wear this tiara. 
And this hairstyle complements it.
Anything to become stronger... 

MARS:
...L-legendary power?
Oh, Xane's handiwork, I see.
He can certainly be a handful... 


MS015_EV1:
*EST enters*
EST:
I'm sorry, Abel...
It's all my fault... 


MS015_OP1:
*SOLDIER_RED enters**EIBEL enters*
SOLDIER_RED:
General, the missing Altean remnants
have at long last been sighted! 

EIBEL:
Is that so? Heh heh...
How convenient. We will draw them
in and be rid of them all at once. 

SOLDIER_RED:
Understood. But what of that knight? 

EIBEL:
You mean Abel? 
Should it look as though he intends to
betray us... Kkkkccchhhh!
Kill the hostage!! 
Besides, he's nothing but a deserter;
it's far too late for him to pledge
loyalty to his prince again. 
Heh heh... now that Abel is
their enemy, how will they fight...?
This should be quite the show... 


MS015_OP2:
*MARS enters**TOMS enters*
TOMS:
Prince Marth,
I have been waiting for you.
And you have finally returned. 

MARS:
Oh! Dolph! 
You're a general of Archanea, though;
why would you come to my side? 

TOMS:
I've given up my position and
have left Emperor Hardin's side. 
There is no justice left in Archanea.
But justice lies in your Altea.
And that's why I've come to you. 

MARS:
I see.
Then Dolph, will you fight with us? 

TOMS:
Indeed I shall.
Let this battle be a testament to
my faith in you. 


MS015_TK1:
*MARS enters**ABEL enters*
MARS:
Abel!?
Why are you...!? 
I can't believe you would turn
against your own motherland! 

ABEL:
Prince Marth... 
Please forgive me...
They took Est...
I have to fight... or they'll kill her. 
...But, seeing that I've met you here...
I--I can't do it anymore...
I just can't fight you, sire. 
Est... please, forgive me...! 


MS015_TK2:
*EST enters**ABEL enters*
EST:
Abel...
I'm sorry.
It hurt, didn't it? 

ABEL:
Est!
Thank heavens you're safe. 

EST:
Yeah, Prince Marth saved me. 
You don't have to fight anymore.
It's okay now.
I'm safe. 

ABEL:
I see. Those blasted Archaneans!
How can I possibly make it up to
Prince Marth...? 

EST:
I'm so sorry, Abel... It's all my fault. 

ABEL:
No, Est!
That's not true! 
It was those Archaneans--
I won't forgive them...
I'll show them the true meaning of pain! 


MS015_VIL1:
*MARS enters**UNCLE enters*
UNCLE:
So you've come, Prince Marth.
I've been waitin' to deliver this to you. 
There's always been bad blood between
our village and the next one over. 
They'll have closed the gates to you
the moment they saw you come here. 
No need to worry, though.
We've got better offerings than them! 


MS015_H1:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
Apparently there are hordes of enemy
soldiers waitin' in the fortresses.
This ain't the time to let your guard down! 


MS015_H2:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
You...
Where the hell did you lot disappear to? 
Nobody had a clue where you went!
We were worried sick! 


MS015_H3:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
Y'know, Gra's not too fond of Altea. 
But sometimes I just gotta wonder if
Archanea's just forcin' Gra to fight us. 


MS015_H4:
*WOMAN2 enters*
WOMAN2:
After the castle fell,
Princess Elice was stolen away
by eerie priests in black robes. 
Oh... Princess Elice...
I sure hope she's safe... 


MS015_H5:
*WOMAN1 enters*
WOMAN1:
Our days under the empire's occupation
have been anything but bright. 
But we kept faith.
We knew that you would return for us,
Prince Marth. 
If anyone could save us from our
suffering, t'would be you. 
You, sire, are the warrior of light--
chosen by the gods...
Glory to our star and savior! 


MS015_H6:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
There are plenty o' enemy spies
lurkin' in this region. 
Be careful!
I think I just saw some movement
from one o' the fortresses. 


MS015_H7:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
The mercenaries protecting the castle
are the cream of the crop. 
They're terrifying enemies for sure,
but I wonder if you could make an
ally out of them? 


MS015_BT_ABEL:
*ABEL enters*
ABEL:
Prince Marth... please, forgive me...
I... I don't want to lose Est... 


MS015_BT_BOSS:
*EIBEL enters*
EIBEL:
Damn it!
You're not human!
No human could defeat my mighty army! 


MS015_DIE_ABEL:
*ABEL enters*
ABEL:
Farewell, Est... 


MS015_DIE_BOSS:
*EIBEL enters*
EIBEL:
How could Archanea be defeated...?
Nngh...! 


MS015_ED1_PCF1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
That was quite a battle.
Is everyone alright? 

JEIGUN:
There's no need for concern, sire.
Everybody has eagerly awaited this day. 
*JEIGUN leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sir Jagen speaks truly.
We've been fighting for this day--
the day we reclaim our homeland. 

MARS:
Yet, because of Archanea's actions,
so many innocent lives have been lost. 
How can I face them...? 
I've caused them great sorrow.
Because I was too weak... 
Was I presumptuous in believing
I could protect my homeland? 

PLAYER:
Sire... 
Do you remember, sire?
The words you said to us on the
very first day of our training? 
PLAYER
MARS:
......
Of course. I could never forget...... 



MS015_ED1_PCM1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
That was a tough battle.
Is everyone alright?

Don't worry, sire.

PLAYER:
Sir Jagen speaks truly.
We've been fighting for this day--

MARS:
Yet, so many innocent lives have
been stolen by Archanea. 
No apology is worthy for them... 
I've caused them great sorrow.
Because of my unreliability... 
Was I presumptuous in believing
I could protect my homeland? 

PLAYER:
Sire... 
Do you remember, sire?
The words you said to us on the
very first day of our training? 
PLAYER
MARS:
......
Of course. I could never forget......

MARS:
By the way, PLAYER,
About your tiara... 
Did it work?
Did you feel the, er, legendary power? 
PLAYER:
No, I didn't feel any different. 

MARS:
As I suspected...
PLAYER, I believe Xane pulled
a fast one on you. 

PLAYER:
I-is that so...? 

MARS:
In light of this,
would you like to return your hair
to the way it was before? 

MS015_ED3_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, thank you. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Good, I'm glad we've sorted that out. 


MS015_ED3_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
No, thank you.
Maybe it just takes a while for
the legendary power to manifest. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You, um, still believe Xane...? 
Well, if that's what you really want,
I suppose I shan't persuade you further.
