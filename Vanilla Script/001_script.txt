MARS:
, we'll be arriving shortly. 
This is your first real battle, is it not? 
Battles will be different from here on out.
Defeat on the battlefield means death. 
Any allies you lose will never return...
That is the harsh reality of war. 
You must take the utmost care not to get
yourself killed. 

PLAYER:
Of course, sire. 


MARS:
You, and everyone else...
It would be wonderful if we could end this
battle without losing anyone... 

PLAYER:
Sire... 

*PLAYER leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we have made arrangements for a
transport convoy. 
We will also have merchants accompanying
us, who will sell us weapons and items. 
I daresay they will be invaluable during
battle preparations. 
MARS:
Thank you, Jagen.
Then let's begin our preparations at once.

MS001_OP1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, this is General Lang, the commanding
officer of the occupational forces. 
*JEIGUN leaves**RANG enters*
RANG:
Oho, so you are Prince Marth?
Glad you could make it here. 
Since you've come all this way, I suppose
I'll let you have the glory of capturing the
rebel leader, General Lorenz. 

MARS:
What?!
General Lorenz leads the rebels?! 
What would possess him to rebel of all
things?! 

RANG:
Who knows?
I haven't the foggiest idea, and frankly
I don't care. 
Prince. You are to kill General Lorenz,
and reclaim the children of the Grustian
royal family that he's hiding. 
While you do that... 
We will slaughter the families of those who
participated in this rebellion and raze their
homes to the ground. 

MARS:
Are you insane?!
They're innocent civilians! 


RANG:
"I-insane"!?
Young man, are you questioning my orders?! 

Perhaps Altea, too, plans to rebel against
Archanea...? 


MARS:
Of course not! That's not... 


RANG:

Prince Marth, your tiny country means
absolutely nothing to me. 
Your rude behaviour is merely an irritation. 
Do not forget that I have the power of the
empire behind me: 
I can crush weak, pesky insects like you
any time I wish. 


MS001_OP1_02:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters**JEIGUN leaves**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
Jagen...
What in the world is going on here? 
How could Hardin have entrusted this
country to such a vile man? 

JEIGUN:
Sire, I understand how you feel.
However, Lorenz has begun a rebellion. 
That much seems to be true, so we ought
to do something about that first. 
Sire, why don't you try speaking to
General Lorenz personally? 
Allow me to stay by your side and serve
as your tactician. 


MS001_OP1_03A_PCF1:

Royal Guard PLAYER! 
When Prince Marth is in danger on the
battlefield, protect him at all costs.
That is an order!

Acknowledged.

MARS:
, I have no need to worry if
you're here. 
Let's clean up the bandits,
and head to General Lorenz's position!

Yes sir!

Oh? A battle, is it? We're in luck, boys!
Let's loot 'em villages before 'ey realize
what's hit 'em! 


MS001_EV1:
*ROLENSE enters**OGUMA enters*
ROLENSE:
Alright, that will do for now...
Sir Ogma, please forgive me for getting you
involved in this mess. 

OGUMA:
I am here on King Talys's orders. 
As such, I will do everything in my power to
help. 

ROLENSE:
I see... Then I have a favor to ask of you.
I want you to escort these children to
Macedon. 
These children...
Prince Yubello and Princess Yumina,
are King Grust's orphans. 
Please.
Take them safely to Lord Wendell in
Macedon. 

OGUMA:
Understood...
I will guard these two with my life. 

ROLENSE:
Thank you, Sir Ogma... 

*OGUMA leaves**YUMINA enters*
ROLENSE:
Now, Prince Yubello, Princess Yumina,
you will be leaving with Sir Ogma. 

YUMINA:
No! I'm not going!
I won't leave you behind! 

ROLENSE:
Princess...
I cannot go. 
With this wound, I can barely even walk. 
It saddens me, but you two must go on
without me. 

YUMINA:
You took that grievous wound to protect us... 
How can you tell us to just leave you behind
now?! 
I will never leave.
We will never leave your side, Lorenz!! 
*YUMINA leaves**OGUMA enters*
OGUMA:
What shall I do, General? 

ROLENSE:
Hmm... this is most troublesome. 
Princess Yumina is not one to change her
mind easily... We will remain here. 

OGUMA:
In that case, I will find some other way to
help you. 
I will find Lang and bring him down...
I will bury him with this sword, I swear on it. 
General Lorenz, you must hold out until then...! 


MS001_TK1:
*ROLENSE enters**MARS enters*
ROLENSE:
Prince Marth!
So it is you... 
How unfortunate, that I must fight...
the Altean Army and its prince... 

MARS:
Please, wait.
I do not wish to fight with you. 
I heard about everything from the villagers.
I've heard of all the atrocities Archanea
has committed. 
I promise, I will inform Emperor Hardin of
the truth and rescue Grust. 
So please, lower your weapons. 

ROLENSE:
Prince...
I am grateful for the offer. 
But, I am afraid that I cannot comply.
Prince, you know nothing. 
Do you think that a man of Emperor Hardin's
caliber would make a general out of a man as
worthless as Lang without good reason? 
He called for an invasion: to crush the
kingdom of Grust and make it a territory
of the Empire. 

MARS:
No, it can't be!
Hardin would never do something like that. 

ROLENSE:
I know it's hard to believe.
But I'm afraid that, ever since he became
emperor, he has changed a great deal. 
He is no longer the Hardin you once knew. 
Prince, I have one final request of you. 
In this stronghold, I am protecting the young
prince and princess of Grust. 
Please, find a way to help them. 
If you can do just that, I will have no regrets. 

MARS:
What...
General Lorenz, what are you saying...?! 

ROLENSE:
Prince Marth...
My life in exchange for theirs...
By any means necessary, please help them... 
This is the last thing I will ask... 


MS001_TK1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
General Lorenz!! 
......This can't be happening...... 


MS001_H1:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
I only saw him briefly, but that knight, Arran,
looked awfully pale. 
You know, he's probably hit the wall, so to
speak. 
I doubt he'll get any stronger, no matter how
much he fights... 


MS001_H2:
*UNCLE enters*
UNCLE:
There aren't any young girls left in this
country. 
They were all taken away by the imperial
troops. 
They say General Lang keeps the really
pretty ones to himself. 
What a dark, insane chapter in Grust's
history... 


MS001_H3:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
The late King Grust had two children. 
Princess Yumina and Prince Yubello.
They're still young. 
Maybe thirteen, or fourteen;
cute little twins, both of them. 
In the last war, Gharnef, the Dark Pontifex,
kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king. 
They were taken to Khadein, the city of magic,
and locked away in a pitch-black room. 
At great personal risk, Pontifex Wendell
saved them. 
He took them to a monastery to protect them. 


MS001_H4:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
General Lorenz took the royal children from
Lord Wendell and raised them in Grust. 
The empire demanded their extradition,
but Lorenz was afraid they would be killed,
and hid them. 
The empire branded Lorenz a traitor,
and sent General Lang here. 
Lang did horrible things to find the royal
children. That's why we rose up. 
But, we lost.
And now Lang is going to kill everyone in
this entire country! 


MS001_H5:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
I heard that General Lorenz lived in Talys
when he was young. 
Talys wasn't unified at the time, so there
were a number of noble houses contending
for control. 
Lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch
of one house, and together they unified
Talys into one country. 
Lorenz and that patriarch--now the king of
Talys--remain close friends to this day. 


MS001_H6:
*WOMAN1 enters*
WOMAN1:
After the last war, Princess Nyna let this
country keep its sovereignty under the rule
of General Lorenz. 
However, as soon as Hardin became
emperor, General Lorenz was banished
and Lang's troops came crawling in. 
Lang stole everything from us. 
He stole our gold, of course, but he even
stole our food and our loved ones... 
Ah...
If only General Camus were here! 
Then we wouldn't have to live in fear of
people like Lang! 


MS001_VIL1:
*MARS enters**OLDWOMAN enters*
OLDWOMAN:
Oh...
Please, show mercy to just this child.
She's only ten years old. 

MARS:
Ma'am, please calm yourself.
I am not here to take any children. 

OLDWOMAN:
What...
You're not imperial soldiers? 

MARS:
No... We're not.
We didn't come to fight. 
If there's anything you need, please ask.
It's not much, but we can give you food. 
*OLDWOMAN leaves**MARICIA enters*
MARICIA:
Wait...
Please, take me with you... 


MARS:
Huh...?
You're... Are you really ten? 

MARICIA:
No... I'm a grown woman, but Granny lied so
that I wouldn't be taken away by the soldiers. 
Lang's soldiers are all monstrous.
But you're different.
You have very sweet eyes. 
Please, take me with you.
I want you to take me away from this
country, and take me to yours. 
*MARICIA leaves**OLDWOMAN enters*
OLDWOMAN:
It's not safe for her to stay here.
Please take her with you, and protect her. 
You can marry her, too, if you like. 
Malicia is a beautiful, good-natured lady,
just like me! I'm sure she'll make a fine
wife. 
*MARS leaves**MARICIA enters*
MARICIA:
No-no-no!
Granny, it's far too early for that!
Now you've made Malicia all flustered! 


MS001_BT_BOSS:
*ROLENSE enters*
ROLENSE:
What?! You're... the Altean army?! 
So even Altea has turned on us... 

MS001_DIE_BOSS:
*ROLENSE enters*
ROLENSE:
Forgive me, people of Grust... 

MS001_ED0:
*VILHEAD enters**MARS enters*
VILHEAD:
Prince Marth...
General Lorenz entrusted everything to you. 
You spared his life, and even heard him out.
We, the people of Grust, thank you. 
Please, let me offer you a token of our
gratitude. Here. 
We're protecting Prince Yubello and
Princess Yumina in this stronghold. 
I beg you, do what you must to protect
our last fragments of hope... 


MS001_ED1:
*YUBELLO enters**MARS enters*
MARS:
You, you're...
Grust's royal heirs...
Prince Yubello and Princess Yumina?! 

YUBELLO:
Sniff...
Lorenz... He's gone.
How can we live on without him? 
*YUBELLO leaves**YUMINA enters*
YUMINA:
You monsters!! Stay away!
You're going to murder us just like you
murdered Lorenz!! 

MARS:
No, you have it all wrong!!
We just... 


MS001_ED1_01:
*RANG enters**MARS enters*
RANG:
Ah... Prince Marth.
You finally caught these filthy traitors. 

MARS:
General Lang! Wait, please!
These children have done nothing wrong.
Allow me to take custody of them. 

RANG:
Don't make me laugh.
These brats are coming with me to my castle. 
Besides, my dear prince, you have other,
more important, priorities. 
I have received reports that there
has been a military revolt in Macedon,
and Princess Minerva has been imprisoned. 

MARS:
What...?!
How could that happen to Macedon?! 

I understand my obligations, General Lang.
Still, these children...
Let them stay with me, please. 

RANG:
Prince, do not try my patience!
Listen up you two! You're coming with me! 


MS001_ED1_02:
*YUMINA enters*
YUMINA:
No, let me go!!
Yubello... help me!! 
*YUMINA leaves**YUBELLO enters*
YUBELLO:
Yumina... Yumina...!! 


MS001_ED1_03_PCF1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Wait!!
Lang! Release them at once! 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire! Give me the order, and I'll get them
safely back at once! 
*MARS leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, don't do it!!
You too, PLAYER! 
If we oppose Lang right here, right now,
we run the risk of being branded traitors
by Archanea. 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
But Jagen, are you telling me to simply allow
Lang to take them?!
I cannot stand for that... 

JEIGUN:
I understand how you feel, sire...
But please remain patient for a little longer. 
If we head to Macedon... then rescue
Princess Minerva, Macedon will surely lend
us its strength. 


MS001_ED1_03_PCM1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Wait!!
Lang! Release them at once! 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Sire! I can still save them!
Please, just give me the word!! 
*MARS leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, don't do it!!
You too, PLAYER! 
If we oppose Lang right here, right now,
we run the risk of being branded traitors
by Archanea. 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
But Jagen, are you telling me to simply allow
Lang to take them?!
