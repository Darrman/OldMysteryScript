MS001_OP1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, this is General Lang, the commanding
officer of the occupational forces. 
*JEIGUN leaves**RANG enters*
RANG:
Oho, so you are Prince Marth?
Glad you could make it here. 
Since you've come all this way, I suppose
I'll let you have the glory of capturing the
rebel leader, General Lawrence. 

MARS:
What?!
General Lawrence leads the rebels?! 
What would possess him to rebel of all
things?! 

RANG:
Who knows?
I haven't the foggiest idea, and frankly
I don't care. 
Prince. You are to kill General Lawrence,
and reclaim the children of the Grunian
royal family that he's hiding. 
While you do that... 
We will slaughter the families of those who
participated in this rebellion and raze their
homes to the ground. 

MARS:
Are you insane?!
They're innocent civilians! 


RANG:
"I-insane"!?
Young man, are you questioning my orders?! 

Perhaps Aritia, too, plans to rebel against
Akaneia...? 


MARS:
Of course not! That's not... 


RANG:

Prince Marth, your tiny country means
absolutely nothing to me. 
Your rude behaviour is merely an irritation. 
Do not forget that I have the power of the
empire behind me: 
I can crush weak, pesky insects like you
any time I wish. 


MS001_OP1_02:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters**JEIGUN leaves**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
Jeigan...
What in the world is going on here? 
How could Hardin have entrusted this
country to such a vile man? 

JEIGUN:

General Lang was once a noble of Akaneia.
However, in the previous war, he
supported the Durhua Empire. I heard 
that he stole from other people,
to add to his own wealth. I fear he has
continued his ways at Grunia, and 
caused suffering to its people. So
General Lawrence's rebellion is
completely understandable. 

MARS:
Jeigan! How can you say things
so casually? If we don't inform Hardin of
the truth, more innocent people will be killed. 

JEIGUN:
Sire, I understand how you feel.
However, Lawrence has begun a rebellion. 
That much seems to be true, so we ought
to do something about that first. 
Sire, why don't you try speaking to
General Lawrence personally? 


MARS:
But the rebels don't know that we're
from Aritia.
Can we reach the fortress safely? 

JEIGUN:
Don't worry.
Most of the rebels have already fled.
All that remains is Lawrence, and the 
children in the fortress. Blocking our
path are only bandits, who have taken
advantage of the confusion to raid 
villages. They are no problem for us.
You can order Alan to defeat them
in one blow if you want. However, 
your highness, we have some fresh
recruits in our army that could use
some fighting experience. 
To them, bandits are relatively strong foes.
So be careful not to push them too much.
If possible, I would have liked to fight as 
well, but my body is not what it used to be.
Allow me to stay by your side and serve
as your tactician. 


MS001_OP1_03A_PCF1:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well then, sire; let us march onwards! 


MS001_OP1_03A_PCM1:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well then, sire; let us march onwards! 


MS001_OP1_03B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well then, sire; let us march onwards! 


MS001_EV0:
*BANDIT enters*
BANDIT:
Oh? A battle, is it? We're in luck, boys!
Let's loot 'em villages before 'ey realize
what's hit 'em! 


MS001_EV1:
*ROLENSE enters**OGUMA enters*
ROLENSE:
Alright, that will do for now...
Sir Oguma, please forgive me for getting you
involved in this mess. 

OGUMA:
I am here on King Talis's orders. 
As such, I will do everything in my power to
help. 

ROLENSE:
I see... Then I have a favor to ask of you.
I want you to escort these children to
Macedonia. 
These children...
Prince Yubello and Princess Yumina,
are King Grunia's orphans. 
I have always been protecting them in
secret, but that is no longer possible. 
If they fell into General Lang's hands, I
bet he would execute them without question. 
Please.
Take them safely to Lord Wendel in
Macedonia. 

OGUMA:
Understood...
I will guard these two with my life. 

ROLENSE:
Thank you, Sir Oguma... 

*OGUMA leaves**YUMINA enters*
ROLENSE:
Now, Prince Yubello, Princess Yumina,
you will be leaving with Sir Oguma. 

YUMINA:
No! I'm not going!
I won't leave you behind! 

ROLENSE:
Princess...
I cannot go. 
With this wound, I can barely even walk. 
It saddens me, but you two must go on
without me. 

YUMINA:
You took that grievous wound to protect us... 
How can you tell us to just leave you behind
now?! 
I will never leave.
We will never leave your side, Lawrence!! 
*YUMINA leaves**OGUMA enters*
OGUMA:
What shall I do, General? 

ROLENSE:
Hmm... this is most troublesome. 
Princess Yumina is not one to change her
mind easily... We will remain here. 

OGUMA:
In that case, I will find some other way to
help you. 
I will find Lang and bring him down...
I will bury him with this sword, I swear on it. 
General Lawrence, you must hold out until then...! 


MS001_TK1:
*ROLENSE enters**MARS enters*
ROLENSE:
Prince Marth!
So it is you... 
How unfortunate, that I must fight...
the Aritian Army and its prince... 

MARS:
Please, wait.
I do not wish to fight with you. 
I heard about everything from the villagers.
I've heard of all the atrocities Akaneia
has committed. 
I promise, I will inform Emperor Hardin of
the truth and rescue Grunia. 
So please, lower your weapons. 

ROLENSE:
Prince...
I am grateful for the offer. 
But, I am afraid that I cannot comply.
Prince, you know nothing. 
Do you think that a man of Emperor Hardin's
caliber would make a general out of a man as
worthless as Lang without good reason? 
He called for an invasion: to crush the
kingdom of Grunia and make it a territory
of the Empire. 

MARS:
No, it can't be!
Hardin would never do something like that. 

ROLENSE:
I know it's hard to believe.
But I'm afraid that, ever since he became
emperor, he has changed a great deal. 
He is no longer the Hardin you once knew. 
Prince, I have one final request of you. 
In this stronghold, I am protecting the young
prince and princess of Grunia. 
Please, find a way to help them. 
If you can do just that, I will have no regrets. 

MARS:
What...
General Lawrence, what are you saying...?! 

ROLENSE:
Prince Marth...
My life in exchange for theirs...
By any means necessary, please help them... 
This is the last thing I will ask... 


MS001_TK1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
General Lawrence!! 
......This can't be happening...... 


MS001_H1:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
I only saw him briefly, but that knight, Alan,
looked awfully pale. 
You know, he's probably hit the wall, so to
speak. 
I doubt he'll get any stronger, no matter how
much he fights... 


MS001_H2:
*UNCLE enters*
UNCLE:
There aren't any young girls left in this
country. 
They were all taken away by the imperial
troops. 
They say General Lang keeps the really
pretty ones to himself. 
What a dark, insane chapter in Grunia's
history... 


MS001_H3:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
The late King Grunia had two children. 
Princess Yumina and Prince Yubello.
They're still young. 
Maybe thirteen, or fourteen;
cute little twins, both of them. 
In the last war, Garnef, the Demon King,
kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king. 
They were taken to Khadein, the city of magic,
and locked away in a pitch-black room. 
At great personal risk, Archbishop Wendel
saved them. 
He took them to a monastery to protect them. 


MS001_H4:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
General Lawrence took the royal children from
Lord Wendel and raised them in Grunia. 
The empire demanded their extradition,
but Lawrence was afraid they would be killed,
and hid them. 
The empire branded Lawrence a traitor,
and sent General Lang here. 
Lang did horrible things to find the royal
children. That's why we rose up. 
But, we lost.
And now Lang is going to kill everyone in
this entire country! 


MS001_H5:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
I heard that General Lawrence lived in Talis
when he was young. 
Talis wasn't unified at the time, so there
were a number of noble houses contending
for control. 
Lawrence lent his power to the young patriarch
of one house, and together they unified
Talis into one country. 
Lawrence and that patriarch--now the king of
Talis--remain close friends to this day. 


MS001_H6:
*WOMAN1 enters*
WOMAN1:
After the last war, Princess Nina let this
country keep its sovereignty under the rule
of General Lawrence. 
However, as soon as Hardin became
emperor, General Lawrence was banished
and Lang's troops came crawling in. 
Lang stole everything from us. 
He stole our gold, of course, but he even
stole our food and our loved ones... 
Ah...
If only General Camus were here! 
Then we wouldn't have to live in fear of
people like Lang! 


MS001_VIL1:
*MARS enters**OLDWOMAN enters*
OLDWOMAN:
Oh...
Please, show mercy to just this child.
She's only ten years old. 

MARS:
Ma'am, please calm yourself.
I am not here to take any children. 

OLDWOMAN:
What...
You're not imperial soldiers? 

MARS:
No... We're not.
We didn't come to fight. 
If there's anything you need, please ask.
It's not much, but we can give you food. 
*OLDWOMAN leaves**MARICIA enters*
MARICIA:
Wait...
Please, take me with you... 


MARS:
Huh...?
You're... Are you really ten? 

MARICIA:
No... I'm a grown woman, but Granny lied so
that I wouldn't be taken away by the soldiers. 
Lang's soldiers are all monstrous.
But you're different.
You have very sweet eyes. 
Please, take me with you.
I want you to take me away from this
country, and take me to yours. 
*MARICIA leaves**OLDWOMAN enters*
OLDWOMAN:
It's not safe for her to stay here.
Please take her with you, and protect her. 
You can marry her, too, if you like. 
Malliesia is a beautiful, good-natured lady,
just like me! I'm sure she'll make a fine
wife. 
*MARS leaves**MARICIA enters*
MARICIA:
No-no-no!
Granny, it's far too early for that!
Now you've made Malliesia all flustered! 


MS001_BT_BOSS:
*ROLENSE enters*
ROLENSE:
What?! You're... the Aritian army?! 
So even Aritia has turned on us... 

MS001_DIE_BOSS:
*ROLENSE enters*
ROLENSE:
Forgive me, people of Grunia... 

MS001_ED0:
*VILHEAD enters**MARS enters*
VILHEAD:
Prince Marth...
General Lawrence entrusted everything to you. 
You spared his life, and even heard him out.
We, the people of Grunia, thank you. 
Please, let me offer you a token of our
gratitude. Here. 
We're protecting Prince Yubello and
Princess Yumina in this stronghold. 
I beg you, do what you must to protect
our last fragments of hope... 


MS001_ED1:
*YUBELLO enters**MARS enters*
MARS:
You, you're...
Grunia's royal heirs...
Prince Yubello and Princess Yumina?! 

YUBELLO:
Sniff...
Lawrence... He's gone.
How can we live on without him? 
*YUBELLO leaves**YUMINA enters*
YUMINA:
You monsters!! Stay away!
Otherwise, we'll kill ourselves!! 

MARS:
No, you have it all wrong!!
We just... 


MS001_ED1_01:
*RANG enters**MARS enters*
RANG:
Ah... Prince Marth.
You finally caught these filthy traitors. 

MARS:
General Lang! Wait, please!
These children have done nothing wrong.
Allow me to take custody of them. 

RANG:
Don't make me laugh.
These brats are coming with me to my castle. 
I must also execute them as soon as
possible, so that other people dare
not defy us. 
Besides, my dear prince, you have other,
more important, priorities. 
I have received reports that there
has been a military revolt in Macedonia,
and Princess Minerva has been imprisoned. 

MARS:
What...?!
How could that happen to Macedonia?! 

I understand my obligations, General Lang.
If it's to rescue Princess Minerva,
I will gladly go. 
Still, these children...
Let them stay with me, please. 

RANG:
Prince, do not try my patience!
Listen up you two! You're coming with me! 


MS001_ED1_02:
*YUMINA enters*
YUMINA:
No, let me go!!
Yubello... help me!! 
*YUMINA leaves**YUBELLO enters*
YUBELLO:
Yumina... Yumina...!! 


MS001_ED1_03_PCF1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Wait!!
Lang! Release them at once! 

*MARS leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, don't do it!! 

If we oppose Lang right here, right now,
we run the risk of being branded traitors
by Akaneia. 
*MARS enters*
MARS:
But Jeigan, are you telling me to simply allow
Lang to take them?!
I cannot stand for that... 

JEIGUN:
I understand how you feel, sire...
But please remain patient for a little longer. 
If we head to Macedonia... then rescue
Princess Minerva, Macedonia will surely lend
us its strength. 


MS001_ED1_03_PCM1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Wait!!
Lang! Release them at once! 
*MARS leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, don't do it!! 
If we oppose Lang right here, right now,
we run the risk of being branded traitors
by Akaneia. 
*MARS enters*
MARS:
But Jeigan, are you telling me to simply allow
Lang to take them?!
I cannot stand for that... 

JEIGUN:
I understand how you feel, sire...
But please remain patient for a little longer. 
If we head to Macedonia... then rescue
Princess Minerva, Macedonia will surely lend
us its strength.
