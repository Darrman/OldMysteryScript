C'mon, you're exaggeratin'![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Teehee. Ricardo,[Pause=3] it seems I have
misunderstood you.[A][ClearBox]I was unaware of how thieves operate,
so I thought they were all bad people.
But you're different, aren't you?[A][ClearBox]You desperately seek gold[Pause=3], but only so you
can save people. Am I right?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]W-well, sorta![Pause=3]

How did you come by this?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

From a traveler. Yeah, a traveler.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=NABARL]Ricardo, show me your tongue.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Eeeeeeeek[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
No, no, I remembered wrong.[Pause=3]
Errr[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I found it lyin' around as I passed by a

Taking things without permission is a terrible
thing to do.[A][ClearBox]No wonder people mistake you for a bandit.[A][ClearBox]I'll go apologize for you later,[Pause=3] so don't do it
again. Am I clear?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yeah, I won't do it again.[Pause=3]

First, there's a rampart HERE.[Pause=3]
We'll cross it and open the door.[A][ClearBox]Then, once we're HERE,[Pause=3] Navarre will take
the lead.[A][ClearBox]Meanwhile, Kashim and I[Pause=3] will stay close behind.[A][ClearBox]We'll take care of any guys who escape
from you, Navarre.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Though I hardly think there's anyone who'd
survive my blade[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Eeek[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
No, no, gotta focus.[A][ClearBox]Either way, I'll show 'em my moves[Pause=3] as soon

Oh, woe is me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

come with us unless you were comin'.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=NABARL]I don't remember saying that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You don't need to say anythin'![Pause=3]
I can tell these things![A][ClearBox]Navarre, you're the type that has a soft
spot for a pretty face and the right

with Ricardo as the base.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=RICARD][FaceCommand=0x73]No way[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
I'm so cute and cheerful that everybody
forgives me if I just smile![A][ClearBox]But I don't think copyin' my style would[Pause=3]
suit a serious guy like you, Kashim![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RENA][FaceCommand=0x61]Excuse me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Why is everyone talking about conning and
thievery again?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ahaha.[Pause=3]

Ricardo[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Haha, you're too good of a person.[Pause=3]
Anyway, I'll rest for a bit, too.[Pause=3]
