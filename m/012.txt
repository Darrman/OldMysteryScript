[Unknown0x12]1[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG35][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CHEINE][TargetRight]This place[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] It's incredible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I feel as though I'm burning up just by
standing here.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]This is Flame Barrel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
The fire dragons' graveyard.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]It's where the fire dragons who've
degenerated into savage beasts come to
wait for their death.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Degenerated, you say[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What do you mean by that?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm not sure if you're aware, but the dragon
tribe is dyin'.[A][ClearBox]Those who don't confine their true, dragon
form in a stone eventually lose all reason
and become monsters.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's why they become Mamkutes?[A][ClearBox]Chainy, if you know something about the
dragon tribe, please tell me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]If you really wanna know[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Tens of thousands of years ago, the
dragon tribe settled down on this continent,
and created a civilization.[A][ClearBox]They possessed intellect and abilities far
exceedin' those of humans.[A][ClearBox]But suddenly, outta nowhere, their day of
destruction came.[A][ClearBox]At first, they couldn't bear children.
Then they began to lose their minds,
goin' berserk one after the next.[A][ClearBox]The elders warned that the end of
dragons as a species was approachin'.[Pause=3]
There was no longer any way to prevent it.[A][ClearBox]However, there was one way they could
survive: to discard their identities as
dragons and live on as humans.[A][ClearBox]The dragons fell into a panic.[A][ClearBox]Those who believed the elders sealed their
forms within stones and became humans.[A][ClearBox]But those who couldn't throw away their
pride as a dragon; those who adamantly
refused to become human[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]They eventually lost their minds and became
naught but beasts[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Those fire dragons before us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, they're a livin' example.[Pause=3]
And it's not just them.
There are many others.[A][ClearBox]But they've all gone feral now.[Pause=3]
There's no way for them to go back[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Worse still, they've been manipulated and
degraded like cattle by the fire clans who
rule over this valley.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Well, princey.
Whadya say we get out of here?[A][ClearBox]The clansmen around here ain't friendly;
if we hang around, we'll end up as bait for
their dragon pets.[A][ClearBox][X]

your pirating days[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Forgive me.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]I was lookin' t'start anew, but there be no
place t'go for an outcast like me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]To resume and continue these crimes;
'tis dishonorable indeed.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Daros, you cannot stay here.[Pause=3]
Come with us.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

MS012_ED1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG64][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CHEINE][TargetLeft]Phew! And that be the end of the fire
dragons' valley.[Pause=3] How you doin', princey?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm fine[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I think.[A][ClearBox]Chainy, I believe you said that there were
other feral dragon tribes.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah.[Pause=3] In addition to this valley, there's the
Dragon's Dale, the Ice Dragons' Temple and
the Dragon's Altar[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The Dragon's Altar[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's a demon dragon graveyard in the
mountains of Macedonia.[Pause=3] There, the earth
dragons sleep.[A][ClearBox]Earth Dragons...!? There are other
Earth Dragons besides Mediuth!?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course. Amongst the dragon tribe
they are closest in strength to the Divine
Dragons, and possess tremendous power.[A][ClearBox]They didn't agree with the elders and
left to form their own group.[A][ClearBox]They currently reside at the Durhua
region, but... their fate didn't change.[A][ClearBox]Eventually the Earth Dragons all lost
their minds and, together with the Demon
Dragons and Flying Dragons[A][ClearBox]who had also degenerated, started to
attack humans. 'Course, the humans
barely stood a chance.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Most were annihilated, and the rest pushed
into the desolate corners of the continent.[A][ClearBox]And then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] the divine dragon Narga, strongest
of them all, waged a war for humanity.[A][ClearBox]It was a fierce battle, but Narga emerged
victorious in the end, and sealed the earth
dragons below Durhua, in a deep sleep.[A][ClearBox]And so that the power of the seal would not
wither,[A][ClearBox]she created the "shield of the five orbs"
and placed it in the Raman Temple.[A][ClearBox]But that is already ancient history...
In fact it occurred over 1000 years ago.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I understand now.[A][ClearBox]In other words, our guardian deity Narga
depicted in legend was the divine dragon
that saved humanity.[A][ClearBox]But then, what about the divine sword
Falchion?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Narga took pity on you humans, with no way of
protecting yourselves, so she created it
from one of her fangs.[A][ClearBox]Then, together with the shield, she sealed
it in Raman, and a powerful spell was cast
on the temple, so that only Divine Dragons[A][ClearBox]could enter it. Narga had the remainin' dragon
houses watch over humanity.[A][ClearBox]She put the newly born Chiki to sleep and thus
ended her 5,000-year life.[A][ClearBox]'Cause of all this, Gato's tryin' his best to
carry out Narga's order.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wait, Chainy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Are you telling me[FreezeMouth]...!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes: Gato is a divine dragon.[Pause=3]
And guess what? So am I[FreezeMouth].[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wa-wait, Chainy.
I still don't understand.
What exactly did you mean?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Phew, my throat is really dry.
I can't stand the heat anymore.
Marth, let's hurry along.[A][ClearBox][Fade=40][X]

but might you be Prince Marth?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Who are you[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I am Belf, and these men here are Robert
and Leiden.[Pause=3] We rushed here because we wish
to join your battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROBERTO]We were once knights of the Sable Order
of Grunia, but we have now separated from
our homeland.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LEIDEN]We threw away our ranks as knights, and
now live to protect those who are powerless.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The Sable Order of Grunia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But in the previous war, we fought against
the Sable Order as enemies.[A][ClearBox]Despite that, you're willing to join our army?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BELF]Our general wished for us to protect the
weak, regardless of nationality.[A][ClearBox]He is gone now,[Pause=3] so we would like to fulfill his
