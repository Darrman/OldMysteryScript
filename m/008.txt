Uhm, you should know, I've no plans to

That's why I wanted to speak to you again.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Uhh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]May I just ask, why are you fighting for
Akaneia?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Be-because Akaneia has already taken

don't have to fight you.[A][ClearBox]I'm happy that we could talk again, Roger.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]W-wait[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]As I thought, you're still very kind.[Pause=3]
Dare I say, we don't have girls quite like
you back in Grunia or Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]Um, perhaps[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

But it's no place for humans.[A][ClearBox]Besides the hero Anri, no man has been
there yet.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Anri[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Are you, perchance, referring to the
"Realm of the Gods" from Anri's legends?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm not at liberty to say anything more.
If you want to know more, you should ask
Lord Gato.[A][ClearBox]Anyhow, I have a favor to ask of you.[Pause=3]
