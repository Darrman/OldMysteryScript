[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FREY]Today's lecture[Pause=3] is about Akaneia's most
valued treasure, the "Fire Emblem."[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The "Fire Emblem"[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I hear Prince Marth fought the last war
with it in hand.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right. In the previous War of
Shadows,[Pause=3] the abominable shadow dragon,
Mediuth, invaded Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]Akaneia was crushed by Mediuth's troops,
and House Akaneia was wiped out,[Pause=3] save
for Princess Nina.[A][ClearBox]And it was Princess Nina who entrusted
Prince Marth with the proof of Akaneian
royalty: the "Fire Emblem."[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=f2][Unknown0x12]0[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG11][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=NIENA][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=f0]Then let me give you this.[Pause=4]
This crest is called the Fire Emblem.[A][ClearBox]House Akaneia bestows it only upon a
true champion,[Pause=2] one we believe has the
power to save the world.[A][ClearBox][Fade=48][EyeCommand=f1][Unknown0x12]0[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FREY][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=f0][TargetLeft]Therefore, our connection with Akaneia
runs very deep.[Pause=3] Don't forget that.[A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATARINA][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Oh, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm going out for a bit.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Katarina?[Pause=3]
Why are you[Pause=3] in such a rush?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I've found someone in another platoon who
could join us.[Pause=3] I'm off to talk to her.[A][ClearBox]She's called Cecil.
I can vouch for her ability.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]All of her comrades have deserted,[Pause=3] and it
seems she's in a pickle, now that she's all
alone.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Right, I see.[Pause=3]
In that case, I'd be happy if she joined us.[A][ClearBox]Sir Jeigan did say our battles are going to
become fiercer from now on.[Pause=3]
We need manpower[SpecialSymbol=0x96]every soldier counts.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, I'll do my best.[Pause=3]
Also, I'm hoping to bring along some powerful
weapons as well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Weapons?[Pause=3]
Can you get them?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Err, the truth is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I have some secret connections.[Pause=3]
I can't get them ready right now,[A][ClearBox]but I'll do my best so they'll be available for
your next battle, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I don't really get it, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're not getting involved with anything
dangerous, are you?[Pause=3] You needn't go so far.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]It's alright. Please leave it to me.[Pause=3]
I want to help you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39], any little that
I can.[A][ClearBox]Well, I'll be off now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][X]

MBTK_206_3_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][SpecialText0x14=0x39], reporting.[Pause=3]
Sir Jeigan, did you call for me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Relax, it's nothing serious.[A][ClearBox]You said your name is [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Where did you learn how to fight?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I was originally[Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x30][A][ClearBox]Since I was young, I've been living in a small
village named Sera,[A][ClearBox]together with my grandfather.[Pause=3]
He was the one who trained me.[A][ClearBox]Grandfather was very strict,[Pause=3] and
worked me to the bone, every day.[Pause=3]
Many times, I thought I was going to die[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What's your grandfather's name?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]His name was Maclir.[Pause=3]
I heard he was once a knight of Aritia.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Maclir?[Pause=3]
I see. You must mean Sir Maclir[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Were you acquainted with my grandfather?[A][ClearBox]
[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_206_ARG_A_PCF1
a noble, but I left the
castle due to family circumstances[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][X]

MBTK_206_ARG_B_PCF1
an orphan; I was picked
up when still a baby.[Pause=3][X]

MBTK_206_ARG_C_PCF1
from the country.[Pause=3][X]

MBTK_206_ARG_D_PCF1
a bishop's daughter,
but then my parents died[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][X]

MBTK_206_ARG_E_PCF1
a peddler's daughter,
but later my parents divorced[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][X]

MBTK_206_3B_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x39], your grandfather was an
old friend of mine.[A][ClearBox]He left the front lines due to injury, [Pause=3]but his
loyalty to House Aritia was unmatched.[A][ClearBox]I see. So Sir Maclir trained you hard and well
so you could become a knight of Aritia.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]"[SpecialText0x14=0x39], become Aritia's sword.
Acquire unbreakable power and loyalty."[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]That's what my grandfather used to say
when he was still alive.[Pause=3]
I grew up with his wish in mind.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see.[Pause=3]
I understand your strength now.[A][ClearBox]You are amazingly capable.[Pause=3]
The lads who will themselves to battle
these days don't have that much power.[A][ClearBox]Clearly, that's[Pause=3] the result of hard training
from an early age.[A][ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I ask of you too.[Pause=3]
Never stop tempering your skills.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Your power is sure to be of use to Prince
Marth.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_207_1_PCF1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FREY]Continuing from the previous lecture,[Pause=3] today's
lecture is about the Kingdom of Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]Today is an exceptional day,
for Prince Marth will speak to you.[Pause=3]
If you would, sire.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][FaceCommand=0x73]Akaneia, was it?[A][ClearBox]The Kingdom of Akaneia is technically
Aritia's suzerain nation.[A][ClearBox]Princess Nina is the last of their royal line,[Pause=3]
and there was debate as to decide who
would rule Akaneia,[A][ClearBox]but I hear Hardin was crowned Emperor of
Akaneia soon after.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=KATARINA][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What kind of person is Emperor Hardin?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]He's a wonderful person.[Pause=3]
In the previous war, Hardin was a precious
ally of ours.[A][ClearBox]As King Orleans's younger brother, he fought
to protect Princess Nina, who had escaped
to the Lea of Orleans.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=f2][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][Unknown0x12]0[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=HARDIN2][LoadBackground=BBG16][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=f0][TargetRight]Tsk, Princess Nina would not be pleased
to hear us nitpicking over who will be
listed in the history books.[A][ClearBox]Take command, so we can oust this
Macedonian scum and be done with it.[A][TargetLeft]Lord Hardin, thank you[FreezeMouth]. [UnfreezeMouth][Pause=4]
That is an honor.[A][ClearBox]If you don't mind me saying so...[A][ClearBox]I feel as though I've made a good friend.[Pause=4]
We share the same ideals, I think.[A][ClearBox][Fade=48][EyeCommand=f1][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][Unknown0x12]0[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=f0]Hardin is well qualified to be emperor.[Pause=3]
If he puts Akaneia into order,
I'm sure everything will go well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=KATARINA][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_207_2_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Let me introduce myself again.[Pause=3]
I am Cecil,[Pause=3] junior knight of the former
9th Platoon.[A][ClearBox]I'd like to make it clear that I'll show no
mercy for those who underestimate me
because I'm a woman[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROOK]Sigh.[Pause=3]
I wish our female knight was a sexy, big
sister type...[A][ClearBox]When we finally get another girl[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why is it Cecil[SpecialSymbol=0x96]the 9th platoon's infamous
violent girl[SpecialSymbol=0x96]of all people?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=CECIL]You little[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Who's the violent girl[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Take this[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] And this[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yikes, w-wait[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Please don't hit me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
B-be gentle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=PLAYER]Sorry.[Pause=3]
I apologize for Luke's rudeness.[Pause=3]
He can be such a troublesome guy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Commander [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] I think you and I are
going to get along very well.[A][ClearBox]Since I've joined this platoon,[Pause=3] I'll fight under
you.[Pause=3] My life is in your hands.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_207_3_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATARINA][EyeCommand=ec][LoadBackground=BBG18][FreezeMouth]...Å@[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER]Katarina,[Pause=3] what are you doing here?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Oh, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I was looking for you.[Pause=3]
Let's go,[Pause=3] it's almost time for the final test[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Huh[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Katarina,[Pause=3] are you crying?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] err[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] this is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's nothing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What happened?[Pause=3]
You can tell me.[Pause=3]
Did anyone do anything to you?[A][ClearBox]We're friends.[Pause=3]
I won't let someone who made you cry get
away with it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
No, that wasn't it.[Pause=3]
I'm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] just sad[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'll tell you the reason later[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
So, let's hurry to the test.[Pause=3]
I'm alright now.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Are you really alright?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes[FreezeMouth]... [UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Your feelings alone are enough for me.[Pause=3]
Thank you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_207_4_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG17][TargetLeft]Hello, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
It's rare for us to meet at a place like this.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, it is, sire.[Pause=3]
Are you going somewhere?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yes. Beyond here[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] are the graves where
sleep the soldiers who fell during the
previous war.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F32][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][Music=BGM_EVT_GRAVE1]My father among them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Many Aritians sacrificed their lives in the
previous war.[A][ClearBox]I couldn't save them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's something I must never forget.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]From the day I decided that being a knight
was my goal, I was prepared to die fighting.[A][ClearBox]Those who fought in the previous war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Weren't they, too, prepared to give their
lives for the kingdom?[A][ClearBox]It's painful, I know, but it isn't something you
must brood over alone, sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Thank you.
I'm happy to hear that.[A][ClearBox]But I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] still feel pain.
When my comrades get hurt and fall,
I can't help but to feel pain[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Even if I'm deluding myself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I don't want to let even a single one of my
comrades die.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_207_4_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Jeigan often tells me that, too.[Pause=3]
"He who leads people must see the big
picture."[A][ClearBox]If one sacrifices few to save many,
that was the correct decision to take.[Pause=3]
I understand that, too.[A][ClearBox]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I don't want that.[Pause=3]
Having to sacrifice someone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Maybe I'm unfit to be king[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Perhaps it's a naive way to think[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But, that's how I really feel.[Pause=3]
And I can't betray my feelings.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ah, sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I must have confused you by suddenly[Pause=3]
talking about all this.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]No, I understand.[A][ClearBox]I do understand[Pause=3] your feelings, sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I don't want any of my comrades to fall,
I want everyone to be alright[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I think that, too.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I want to help you accomplish that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Thank you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][X]

What the hell is this?[Pause=3]
Why is Katarina[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I don't know, either.[A][ClearBox]But when I think about it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] there were some
signs.[Pause=3] Although I never imagined it would come
to this[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LIAN]Err, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What are we going to do?[A][ClearBox]Are we[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] going to fight Katarina?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]We are knights.[Pause=3]
Protecting Prince Marth is our foremost
duty.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_208_2_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG11][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][SpecialText0x14=0x39], it would seem we've fallen into
the enemy's trap. It's too dangerous to
fight them head-on like this.[A][ClearBox]Besides, this is your knighthood ceremony[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I don't want to lose promising people in a
place like this.[A][ClearBox]Please leave everything to me.
I'll find a way of escaping alone.
You don't need to[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Speak no further, sire.[A][ClearBox]I shall fight alongside you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Sire, you told me before that you don't want
to let your comrades die.[A][ClearBox]I feel the same way.
Just like you, sire, wish to protect us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I, too, wish to protect you.
That's what I believe.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROOK][FaceCommand=0x73]Hold it, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I won't let you hog the spotlight all for

We are knights; protecting our liege is our
duty.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LIAN][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] want to[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] protect Prince Marth too.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][FaceCommand=0x73]That's right. We are the 7th Platoon!
We've defeated all our enemies so far.
We can do it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Everyone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]Alright.
Then, are you all ready?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROOK]No kidding[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]The 7th Platoon shall battle together with
our prince[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] And we shall prevail[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_001_1_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG75][SpecialText0x14=0x39], this is the first time you've been
outside of Aritia, isn't it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
Sire, did you come to Grunia[Pause=3] in the previous
war?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed. In the War of Darkness, Grunia was
our enemy.[Pause=3] However, the general and the
people were not to blame.[A][ClearBox]There were many admirable people[Pause=3] that I did
not want to fight.[Pause=3] General Lawrence comes to
mind[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Fortunately, in the previous war, he fought
as our ally.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=f2][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][Unknown0x12]0[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=ROLENSE][LoadBackground=BBG24][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetRight][EyeCommand=f0]So, I will stand by you instead,[Pause=1] Prince[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=4]

and it now follows the Kingdom of
Akaneia's rule,[A][ClearBox]but, by Akaneia's grace, General Lawrence
was allowed to govern it.[A][ClearBox]He's an excellent leader who thinks of his
people.[Pause=3] It's because of him that the people
of Grunia can live in peace.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I understand.[Pause=3]
But then, I wonder why did a rebellion occur?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That, I don't know.[Pause=3]
Just what is going on in this country[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

I am already old,[Pause=3] and would be of no use in

It is an honor to fight alongside you, sir.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN]Sir Alan, as far as our reports go,[Pause=3]
our enemies are bandits.[Pause=3]
They are no match for a Paladin like you.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_001_2_2_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Of course. However, Sir Jeigan,[Pause=3] if possible,
please give a chance to [SpecialText0x14=0x39] and the
other new knights.[A][ClearBox]I can't become much stronger than I already
am.[Pause=3] However, they're young and have
potential.[A][ClearBox]As [SpecialText0x14=0x39] and the others experience
actual battles,[Pause=3] they should eventually grow
enough to surpass me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FreezeMouth]Ah![UnfreezeMouth]
Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]... [UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], [Pause=3]gain strength in the battlefield,[Pause=3]

To think that I'd have to fight here again.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sire, are you perchance acquainted with
Princess Minerva,[Pause=3] who's in the enemy's
hands?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. Princess Minerva[Pause=3] fought in the

her own brother, Prince Misheil.[Pause=3]
All for the peace of Macedonia.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=f2][Unknown0x12]0[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][LoadBackground=BBG40][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MISHEIL][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=f0][TargetLeft]Minerva,[Pause=3] I have missed you, Sister.[Pause=4]

Sounds like they'll be good to have around.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3] However, Est, the youngest of the three,
has retired from knighthood and is living

was ravaged by the dragonkin.[A][ClearBox]The people back then lived days of misery,

But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] if we don't know how,[Pause=3] we may have no
choice but to fight.[A][ClearBox]They're strong.[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], be very careful.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_020_1_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I must remind you of a crucial fact.[A][ClearBox]Only with the Light Orb can we hope to
prevail against Hardin.[A][ClearBox]So you must be absolutely sure that whoever
challenges him carries the Light Orb.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Understood, Sir Jeigan.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_021_1_PCF1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75]Sire, I bring news.[Pause=3]
According to an inhabitant of a nearby
village[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]A young dragon knight,[Pause=3] badly wounded and on
the verge of death, has taken refuge there[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]A dragon knight?[Pause=3]
I wonder who it is?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I don't know who. But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] the knight reportedly
suffered a deep wound that would've killed
any ordinary man[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And, as if talking in delirium,[Pause=3] was apparently
calling your name, sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]Make route for the village at once![Pause=3]
I want to ascertain the knight's identity.[Pause=3]
I must meet with them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_022_1_PCF1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG69]So this is the Dragon's Altar[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]An ominous place for sure.[Pause=3]
I can hear the roars of dragons coming from
somewhere[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, it's dangerous to stay here for too long.[Pause=3]
Once we're ready,[Pause=3] let's go deeper at once.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_023_1_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG69][TargetRight]Sir Jeigan,[Pause=3] in the innermost room, he[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=3]
the Demon King Garnef is waiting[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], listen well.[Pause=3]
Garnef cannot be damaged by regular
weapons.[A][ClearBox]The Maph tome he possesses[Pause=3] has the power
to block our attacks.[A][ClearBox]Only the Starlight tome can pierce Garnef's
shadowy veil.[A][ClearBox]If we don't have Starlight,[Pause=3] then we'll have no
choice but to try and[Pause=3] seize the throne
without fighting Garnef[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_024_1_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][LoadBackground=BBG69]Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] I have a little sister named
Maria.[A][ClearBox]She was kidnapped by Garnef, and now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It seems she's by Mediuth's side.[A][ClearBox]I want to save her.[Pause=3]
I want to talk to her[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]However, according to the Demon King, [Pause=3]
they have become living offerings and their
hearts have been lost[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Even so, I must talk to her.[Pause=3]
Even if I discover nothing I can do can bring
her back[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Even if I have to put an end to her misery[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I will save her.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Princess[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Very well.[Pause=3]
If you're willing to go that far,[Pause=3] I will not
attempt to stop you.[A][ClearBox]I, too, shall support you so that you'll be able
to speak to Princess Maria.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_024_2_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][LoadBackground=BBG69]Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] I have a request for you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Sirius,[Pause=3] what is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]According to Garnef[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Princess Nina, who had been kidnapped,[Pause=3]
is now a living offering to Mediuth.[A][ClearBox]And now she'll never return to normal[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
However, I want to talk to her.[A][ClearBox]I wonder if you could arrange things so[Pause=3]
Prince Marth would allow me to take part in
the next battle?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]However, why Princess Nina?[Pause=3]
Are you familiar with the princess, Sir Sirius?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]No.[Pause=3]
I just want to save her.[A][ClearBox]As the princess of a mighty kingdom,[Pause=3] she
had to endure much sorrow all this time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But, this end would be just too miserable.[A][ClearBox]I cannot make her happy.[Pause=3]
But, at least, I want to save her[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_024_3_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARICH][LoadBackground=BBG69][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I have a request.[Pause=3]
Please lend me your strength in the[Pause=3] next
battle. I want to save Princess Ellis.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Princess Ellis[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Prince Marth's elder sister, correct?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. Ellis is very precious to me.[A][ClearBox]I heard Ellis's heart has been shattered,[Pause=3]
and she now stands with Mediuth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But, I haven't given up.[A][ClearBox]I want to talk to her.[Pause=3]
If both of us take part in the next battle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'd like you to help me create a chance to
talk to Ellis.[Pause=3] Please, I beg of you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Very well.[Pause=3] I have yet to repay you for helping
me before, Sir Marich.[Pause=3] I shall assist you.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_024_4_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JURIAN][LoadBackground=BBG69]Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Is it true that Rena's been found?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes. According to our scouts,[Pause=3] Rena is
currently with my sister and the others.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I have to save Rena.[Pause=3]
Let me talk to her.[Pause=3] I just know I can make
her return to normal.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Julian, I understand your feelings.[Pause=3]
I, too, would like for you to speak to Rena.[A][ClearBox]I still haven't decided who's going to take
part in the final battle, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x39], your
opinion?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=PLAYER]I don't know exactly how deep the
relationship between them runs.[Pause=3]
However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I feel that[Pause=3] Julian's strength will be required[Pause=3]
if we intend to save Sister Rena.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed.[Pause=3]
I will think hard and well about[Pause=3] who to bring
to this next battle.[A][ClearBox]To find the best solution,[Pause=3] not only to win this
battle,[Pause=3] but also to rescue everyone.[A][ClearBox][X]
