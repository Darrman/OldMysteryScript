[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FREY][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Frey,[Pause=3] can I ask you one thing?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What is it, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I want to learn about Garnef[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
the Demon King.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Alright.[Pause=3]
I'll tell you what I know[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]However, why come to me when there are
people far more knowledgeable about this
subject than I?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]That's because you're a teacher to us
new knights, sir.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, originally I wasn't well suited
to teaching, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Because of how things turned out,
I ended up being your lecturer.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Is that so?[Pause=3]
It seemed like you were used to teaching[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Not at all.[Pause=3]
It's just that Sir Kain showed more strength
and skill[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And Sir Abel, while competent, had already
left the knighthood.[A][ClearBox]Meanwhile, Sir Doga and Sir Gordon don't
quite have the personalities fit for
an instructor.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's why you were designated
as instructor, Sir Frey?[A][ClearBox]Was it hard teaching?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, it was.[Pause=3]
Not all pupils are good learners.[A][ClearBox]I knew it was a troublesome task,[Pause=3]
but I hate seeing others struggle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
So I figured I could do that much.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So you're sort to carry the burden
yourself,[Pause=3] Sir Frey.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Haha, perhaps it's as you say.[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FREY][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And then, Prince Marth triumphed against
Garnef's Maph spell by using Starlight.[A][ClearBox]Starlight was[Pause=3] the only magic capable
of felling Garnef.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The sun is about to set.[Pause=3]
Shall we end today's lecture now?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, thank you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Good.
Then, we'll continue tomorrow or[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
[FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]Ugh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Sir Frey[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Are you all right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FREY][EyeCommand=ed]I'm sorry, I twisted my ankle.[Pause=3]
It seems I've gotten old.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Ah[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sir Frey, what is that scar[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]It's an old wound.[Pause=3]
It just hurts sometimes, it's no big deal.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If that's not a big deal, then what is?[Pause=3]
It looks terrible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]How did you come to suffer such a wound?[Pause=3]
Please tell me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]I see your habit of asking me anything
and everything has struck again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Oh well,[Pause=3] this wound[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] is from way back.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You mean, from the previous war[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, even before that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]This is[Pause=3] a wound I suffered so that the
young Prince Marth could escape[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_FREY_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FREY][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Frey[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I spoke to Sir Jeigan.[Pause=3]
He told me about your wound[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You took that wound when Prince Marth, still
a child, was forced to escape Aritia Castle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]In the jaws of death, surrounded by enemies,[Pause=3]
you alone became a decoy,[Pause=3] in order to
protect Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You took such a serious wound,
it's shocking that you're still alive[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][Music=BGM_EVT_GRAVE1][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I believe the enemy struck me down[Pause=3] and left
me for dead.[Pause=3] Actually, it was a miracle that
I was still alive[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]After countless days at the brink of death,
I came about, but without my memories, and
so lived a long time as another identity[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]My memories lost and my body wounded[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Until I had fully recovered[Pause=3]
and returned to Prince Marth,[A][ClearBox]well[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] a few years had already passed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Why were you the decoy, Sir Frey?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]It wasn't just me.[Pause=3]
Everyone there was[Pause=3] ready to become a
decoy as well.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] That's right.[Pause=3]
It was just like when I became an instructor.[A][ClearBox]I felt it'd be a pity[Pause=3] if any of the others
had to be sacrificed.[Pause=3]
So, I figured I could do that much[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
How could you even think that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_FREY_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]Sir Frey[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] your resolve is laudable.[Pause=3]
But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Please take more care of yourself.[A][ClearBox]Think of your own happiness too, Sir Frey.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Otherwise,[Pause=3] you'll be[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'm sorry.[Pause=3]
For making you, my student, worry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I am a failure of a teacher.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]You can say that again.[Pause=3]
Sir Frey, you're always overfilling your
pails with other peoples' burdens.[A][ClearBox]Though my words will probably do nothing
to convince you otherwise[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's in my nature, after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]In that case, from now on, I shall share
half of your burdens, Sir Frey.[A][ClearBox]Please allow[Pause=3] me to carry them.[A][ClearBox]Please[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Don't carry everything by yourself,
Sir Frey[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Very well. Let's do it your way.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]You promised.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, I promise.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_GOHDON_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=GOHDON][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Hmmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]Sir Gordon,[Pause=3] is something troubling you?[A][ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_DISGUST1][TargetLeft]Oh, hey [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
It's nothing important, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] how do I look?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?[Pause=3]
I'm not exactly the best person to ask
for fashion advice[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I was just thinking[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've never really had[Pause=3] any presence.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Presence?[Pause=3]
You mean, like Sir Jeigan?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, the kind of presence people recognize
from a glance: the kind that makes you
nervous even when you've done no wrong.[A][ClearBox]I've got a kiddy face,[Pause=3] so I don't look like
a senior knight much.[Pause=3] The worst part is
when I look even younger than you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It was like that the last time I watched
the new knights training.[A][ClearBox]When the young apprentice knights passed
by me in the castle,[Pause=3] they'd say
"you do your best, too[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]"[A][ClearBox]I can't help but think they mistook me
for an apprentice like themselves[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]S-so you've experienced that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]That's not all, some even wanted me run
errands for them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Because of things like that,[Pause=3]
I want to become respected.[A][ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] could you tell me if
you ever find a good way?[A][ClearBox][X]

Training again today, huh[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]S-sir Gordon?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Good work[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's what an Aritian knight is made of[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But don't think I'll be left in the dust[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What's the matter?[Pause=3]
Do you have a fever?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What? No[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sorry.[Pause=3]
Was I really that weird?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]If you must ask[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Yes, you were.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I-I knew it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I thought I'd become more dignified by
changing the way I speak[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]So I tried to mimic the tone of a
senior knight I respect, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I guess I really can't be somebody I'm not.[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] do you have any ideas on what I
should try next?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What do you think about changing your looks?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Hey, good idea.[Pause=3]
I should make myself look more imposing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Maybe I ought to grow a beard.[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], do you think I'll look dignified
with a beard?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Pff![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]D-did you laugh?[Pause=3]
You imagined me with a beard and laughed,
didn't you?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]S-sorry. I didn't mean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]No, it's fine.[Pause=3]
I guess it really wouldn't suit me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What am I supposed to do[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_GOHDON_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=GOHDON][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Hey, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
You training too?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, are you as well, Sir Gordon?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
I decided to leave the "presence" matter
for now,[Pause=3] and do my best on training.[A][ClearBox]I figured that if I became[Pause=3] more useful in
battle, I'd naturally look more imposing.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's why.[A][ClearBox]I noticed you've been fighting[Pause=3]
far better as of late, Sir Gordon.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]R-really?[Pause=3]
That makes me happy.[A][ClearBox]So do I[Pause=3] look dignified now?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Not really.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I-I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]However, isn't it fine for you to stay
like this, Sir Gordon?[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Eh?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_LOVE2][Pause=3]I think your approachability is a quality
others lack.[A][ClearBox]I, too, feel at ease when you're by my side,
Sir Gordon.[A][ClearBox]I believe the reason they greeted you,[Pause=3]
being anxious new knights themselves,[Pause=3]
was because you left them at ease.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I-is that so?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
Also, when people have worries that they
find hard to divulge[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]They feel like they can[Pause=3] discuss them with
you, Sir Gordon.[A][ClearBox]For instance, say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If somebody is distressed about love[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Were they to thoughtlessly talk to
Sir Jeigan about their problems[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_GOHDON_A_2
[TargetLeft]Ahaha, that wouldn't do.[Pause=3]
He'd flay them alive! I can hear him already:
"You forget your duty as a knight[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]"[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]You're right[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] B-but keep this a secret
from Sir Jeigan, would you?[Pause=3]
Don't tell him I said that.[A][ClearBox]If this leaks out, he'd flay ME alive[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Heehee. You have my word, Sir Gordon.[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_JURIAN_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JURIAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Julian,[Pause=3] I see you're heading out.[Pause=3]
May I ask where to?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Just as I'd expect from Prince Marth's
knight.[Pause=3] You caught onto me quickly.[A][ClearBox]The truth is, I was going to secretly gather
information.[Pause=3] I want to find clues as to where
Rena might be.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sister Rena was your special someone,
wasn't she?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah.[Pause=3]
I used to be a common thief,[Pause=3] but thanks to
her I turned over a new leaf.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]I don't care what happens to me.[Pause=3]
I just want to see her smile again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Sir Julian[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If you'd allow me, please let me help too.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Huh? Is that alright?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes. That desire to do something for those
precious to you[Pause=3] is something I know well.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_JURIAN_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JURIAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Say, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
There's something I really want to ask of you.[A][ClearBox]I wonder if you could teach me how to fight?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]How to fight?[Pause=3]
But Sir Julian, you're a thief[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Rather than battle, you'd do better staying
in the rear, opening chests and doors[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, you're right.[Pause=3]
But, I want to become stronger.[Pause=3]
Strong enough to protect Rena.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Julian[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ever since Rena disappeared,[Pause=3]
I've looked frantically for her everywhere[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I even asked people who chanced to see her.[A][ClearBox]According to them,[Pause=3] when Rena was taken
by the heretic bishops[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] she had a sad
look on her face.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What does that mean[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]They didn't put her to sleep.[Pause=3]
Or use some spell to control her.[A][ClearBox]That time, I wasn't far from her.[Pause=3]
Had Rena screamed,[Pause=3] I'd have noticed
for sure.[A][ClearBox]But, she didn't.[A][ClearBox]That's because she knew I'd be no match
for them even if I rushed out to help.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Were I a much stronger man,[Pause=3]
Rena wouldn't have been kidnapped.[Pause=3]
Knowing that, I just can't forgive myself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JURIAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Julian.[Pause=3]
It's good to train, but don't overdo it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thanks.[Pause=3]
But, I don't want to fail again.[Pause=3]
So[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Julian, I understand why you'd blame
yourself for Miss Rena's tragedy.[A][ClearBox]But, I was thinking.[A][ClearBox]Don't you think Miss Rena[Pause=3] wouldn't seek
your help[Pause=3] even if you were stronger?[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetLeft]Come again?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_PEACEFUL1]It's possible that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Miss Rena just didn't want to see you
in danger.[A][ClearBox]So she chose to sacrifice herself instead
of seeing someone else getting hurt[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I don't know her,[Pause=3] but that's the kind
of woman I imagine from you.[Pause=3]
Am I off the mark?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Mmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Yeah, that's just how Rena is.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Always,[Pause=3] she's thinking of others[FreezeMouth]....[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Instead of herself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Sir Julian[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'll help you.[Pause=3]
Let's bring Miss Rena back together.[A][ClearBox]After listening to your story,[Pause=3]
I now wish to meet Miss Rena.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Why, of course.[A][ClearBox]If you meet Rena,[Pause=3]

However, I am a mere knight.[A][ClearBox]If you want to offer your life,[Pause=3] then you

from me and Prince Marth?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Eeeeeerr[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Of course not, hahaha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]I'm sorry, Mistress [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Truth be told, I'm terrible at makin'
pledges in front of people[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[Pause=3]
Then, how about this[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth]
[A][ClearBox]You make your pledge inside your heart and
protect Prince Marth from the shadows,[Pause=3]
together with me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Y-yes, that sounds good to me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Excellent[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Then, you'll be training together with me,
starting tomorrow.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]T-trainin'?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Yes. We wake up before dawn,[Pause=3] then
first we run ten laps around the base,[Pause=3]
followed by a thousand sword swings[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]E-err[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I did say I would offer me life[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But I'm not doin' that for Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What did you just say?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]N-no, nothing, I was jokin'[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

You're just the kind of person
I thought you were, Sir Kashim.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]T-things have gotten rather complicated[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LIAN][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Oh right, you're Sir Gordon's little brother,
aren't you, Ryan?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. I signed up to become a knight[Pause=3] because
I wanted to be like Brother.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I remember you met every now and then[Pause=3]
during our apprentice days.[Pause=3] I thought it
was nice you had someone close to you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't you have siblings, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Well, no[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]That's why I'm a little envious.[Pause=3]
What's it like having someone close to you
who's around the same age?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Well, my brother's always been in my life so
it's hard to describe it.[A][ClearBox]Oh, but whenever I argued with my parents
or friends[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I liked it when Brother stuck up for me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Teehee. Sounds like a nice family.[Pause=3]
I see. So you quarrel too, Ryan.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]N-not anymore though.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_LIAN_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LIAN][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Apparently Mother and Father wanted to
have a girl.[A][ClearBox]Sometimes I[Pause=3] wonder what it would be like to
have a big sister.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I understand that feeling.[Pause=3]
What if I had a sibling[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That question often crosses my mind.[A][ClearBox]I wanted a brother, maybe.[Pause=3]
A younger one.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Really?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes. If I had a little brother, I think I'd
pamper him a lot.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It'd be nice[Pause=3] if you were my big sister,
[SpecialText0x14=0x39]. Then us three would be siblings.[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Heehee, you're right.[A][ClearBox]Had I been born in your family, Ryan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I think[Pause=3] we'd make good siblings.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, I can picture it.[A][ClearBox]If I had a big sister who's strong and pretty
like you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] I'd brag about you to
everyone.[A][ClearBox][X]

Though it'll be a long time before I can
send it.[A][ClearBox]I wonder if Mother and Father[Pause=3] are alright[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You should take a break[Pause=3] once this war
is over, then.[A][ClearBox]You ought to go home[Pause=3] and spend some quality
time with your family.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, I want to.[A][ClearBox]Won't you go back home, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Mmm.[Pause=3]
Ever since grandfather passed away,[Pause=3]
there's nobody home anyway[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]So, if I'm there all alone,[Pause=3]
I'm only going to feel lonely.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Er, then,[Pause=3] why don't you come to my home?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Your home?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, yes.[Pause=3]
If it's okay with you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I think of you as a big sister, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Thanks, Ryan.[A][ClearBox]I love your idea.[Pause=3]
If you don't think I'm a bother,[Pause=3]
then I would like to visit[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, I'm sure my family will be happy
to meet you too.[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MAJI][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]You are[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sir Maji, right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, you know about me?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?
Why, of course.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see, you show some promise.[A][ClearBox]Even though Saji and I look completely
different,[Pause=3] people get us mixed up
all the time.[A][ClearBox]It kinda bothers me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I think I can understand that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]True, we're both mercenaries from Talis,[Pause=3]
and we're both woodcutters.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see you talk alike, too.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah, well I guess.[Pause=3]
But we're totally different.[Pause=3]
For instance, err[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]That's right, our faces[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've got the more handsome face,
doncha agree?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Handsome[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, take a goood look at my face.[Pause=3]
He can't deny it[Pause=3] either.[A][ClearBox]You, too, remembered I was Maji 'cause
I'm more handsome, right?[A][ClearBox]If you remember Maji's the handsome one,[Pause=3]
then you'll know who's who right away![A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I-indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MAJI_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MAJI][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]That Saji can be a really nosy dude[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]A long time ago, when I was about to
pummel ten bandits[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]He kept butting into my business, saying
ten was too much and that I should stop.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But, Sir Saji's advice sounds reasonable.[Pause=3]
Fighting ten by yourself is rather[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah, but y'see.[Pause=3]
The village was being ransacked.[A][ClearBox]I didn't know that village.[Pause=3]
But I betcha, there were people living
in peace there, just like in my village.[A][ClearBox]And just thinking about those damn bandits
crushing the people and their peace[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I couldn't let that happen.[A][ClearBox]You know that feeling, doncha?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I know it well.[Pause=3]
I too would not allow the bandits to do harm.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, so you do get it.[Pause=3]
I could get along with you.[Pause=3]
Too bad I can't say the same of Saji.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MAJI_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MAJI][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]But y'see,[Pause=3] that Saji is really an
annoying dude[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Even if I wanted to, I can't get rid of
him.[Pause=3] He's always been my pal, see.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Because you recognize each other's worth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Nonsense. You're kidding me, right?[A][ClearBox]When we meet, we fight all the time.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But, even that dude has got one
good point.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]His camaraderie.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Camaraderie[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, that's right.[Pause=3]
To him, long-time comrades are just like
family[SpecialSymbol=0x96]no, above family even.[A][ClearBox]He wouldn't regret putting his life on
the line for his friends.[A][ClearBox]That's why he can't help but meddle in
my matters.[A][ClearBox]He'd never turn his back on his friends.[Pause=3]
No matter what.[A][ClearBox]If something were to happen to me,
he'd be there for me.[Pause=3]
That's why I can be so rash.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]As I thought.[Pause=3]
You really do recognize each other's worth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]N-nonsense.
Were you even listening to me?[A][ClearBox][X]

There's something I must inform you.[Pause=3]
It's an order from Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes. Starting now,[Pause=3] I am to fight alongside
you in the coming battles.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Why must I fight with you?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I don't know what Prince Marth has in mind,[Pause=3]
but it's probably related to the fact that
you fight alone far too often[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I believe he thought that you acting alongside
someone would benefit our army as a whole.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Navarre,[Pause=3]
it is an honor for me to fight alongside
you, a hero of the previous war.[A][ClearBox]I look forward to working with you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

So here you were.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You again?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, it's me again.[Pause=3]
We've been meeting often lately,
be it marching or in the battlefield.[A][ClearBox]We might be able to get along better
than I expected.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]W-why are you looking at me like I'm just
chasing after you[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What's your business with me?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, yes.[Pause=3]
The truth is,[Pause=3]
I heard an unpleasant story the other day.[A][ClearBox]That before you rescued Miss Feena,[Pause=3]
you used to be a bodyguard for bandits[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Is there any truth in the story?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]W-why[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Why would somebody[Pause=3] of your caliber lend a
hand to villainous cutthroats[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Were you forced by circumstances?[Pause=3]
And therfore you had no choice[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]There was no such thing.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm no different from a bandit.[Pause=3]
I'm not like you.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_NABARL_B_2
[TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sir Navarre.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]No,[Pause=3] that's wrong.[Pause=3]
We are the same.[A][ClearBox]After all, you're in this army for Prince

However you've lived amongst bandits till now.[A][ClearBox]And you were thus unwittingly dyed with evil.[Pause=3]
But you can still change that.[A][ClearBox]I'm confident Prince Marth wishes that too.[Pause=3]
And if that's the case,[Pause=3]
I'm sure that's my mission.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Navarre,[Pause=3]
I'll insist and persuade you until you're
an honest man again[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Heh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Did I say something funny?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You're softhearted like Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What do you mean?[Pause=3]
Just like Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

I can fight without worries.[A][ClearBox]We might become[Pause=3] good comrades, I say.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I had no intention of teaming up with you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I don't mind if you think that.[Pause=3]
But, I consider you a precious comrade of

Please let me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] learn from you, Sir Oguma.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I don't understand.[A][ClearBox]You're a full-fledged knight, are you not?[Pause=3]
What do you seek from a mere mercenary?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Oguma, not only are you a hero
from the previous war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But you saved Princess Yumina and Prince
Yubello from an enemy castle,
all by yourself.[A][ClearBox]I don't think you're a "mere" mercenary.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sorry, but find somebody else.[Pause=3]
I'm not someone who teaches others.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm a man who can do nothing but fight.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I want you to fight me.[A][ClearBox]Could I ask you to spar with me, one-on-one?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]What[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]My grandfather used to tell me this:[Pause=3]

is fighting them.[A][ClearBox]Through battle, you get to understand[Pause=3] not
just your opponent's techniques,[Pause=3] but also
their personalities and upbringing.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.[Pause=3]
Your grandfather is correct.[Pause=3]
But, you realize this right?[A][ClearBox]Once I start[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'm not going to play around.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I am prepared.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Very well.[Pause=3]

when you took me by surprise[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Otherwise,[Pause=3] I doubt my body could stand in
a battlefield ever again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]It was a good lesson.[Pause=3]
The way you fight[Pause=3] is completely different
from a knight's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Dirty fighting[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] you mean?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Perhaps I would have called it that,[Pause=3]
had you asked me before this.[A][ClearBox]However,[Pause=3] I couldn't do anything[Pause=3] against
that dirty fighting[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Your fighting style, Sir Oguma, isn't that of
a regular soldier.[Pause=3]
It's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That of a gladiator[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
One who fights to the death for the
pleasure of others.[A][ClearBox]Blinding his opponents' eyes with sand,[Pause=3]
crushing their heads with a sword soaked
in grease and blood[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Roaring like a beast,[Pause=3]
crushing his opponents' flesh
even when they move no longer[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]I was thrown into a place like that when
I was still a kid,[Pause=3] and battled my way
through it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I can't even begin to imagine.[Pause=3]
That place was probably even more terrible
than a battlefield, wasn't it[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]It's a world you're better off not knowing.[Pause=3]

I am a mercenary, and an ex-gladiator.[A][ClearBox]I am a far cry from the chivalry you seek.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I thought so at first, too.[A][ClearBox]That your strength[Pause=3] lay in the fact you've
fought your way through gladiatorial[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
lawless battles.[A][ClearBox]But, having watched you long and well in

I finally understood the truth.[A][ClearBox]That you possess the same heart as
us knights.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The same heart, you say?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
There is somebody inside your heart[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And you fight for that person.[Pause=3]

feeling[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But you're offering your body and soul for

I could help him, even a tiny bit[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You wanted to help Sir Caesar?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yeah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'd pull my load, earn some gold, and then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Oops, I nearly said too much.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I almost forgot Caesar swore me to secrecy.[A][ClearBox]So, I'm afraid I can't say any further.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see, then I won't pry.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]However, I'll pray for your success.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks.[Pause=3]

What's wrong?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hm?[Pause=3]
Oh, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox]Nothing, it's just that I was reading a book
Caesar recommended me earlier, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]it doesn't make a lick of sense to me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What book were you reading?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Oh, this? I've read this book.[Pause=3]
The Fundamentals of Tactics.
It's a good book.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] How convenient.[Pause=3]
Then, please teach me all about it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]It'd help if you could summarize the entire
contents[Pause=3] in a single phrase, if possible.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]That wouldn't benefit you at all.[Pause=3]
This is the kind of book you need to[Pause=3] read
again and again, until you understand it.[A][ClearBox]It's no use just asking others and
pretending like you get it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]Bah.[Pause=3]
You sound just like Caesar.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Why does it feel as though I've gotten yet
another bro?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]That said, I'll teach you if there's any
part you don't understand.[Pause=3]
You can ask me anything.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Uh-huh, got it.[Pause=3]
I'll do my best and give it a shot[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

this war reaches its conclusion?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'll return to Warren.[Pause=3]
By then, I should have saved up
enough money.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[Pause=3]
You refer to the secret from earlier.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Hmmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Well, I reckon it's alright to tell you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]I want to buy medicine for Caesar's lil' sister.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Is she unwell?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, and it's pretty serious.[A][ClearBox]There's good medicine for her condition,[Pause=3]
but it's so expensive it's unreal.[A][ClearBox]That's why I tagged along when Caesar said
his next job[Pause=3] took him far from home.[A][ClearBox]Because Caesar's sister[Pause=3] is like my sister.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that was it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But why keep it a secret?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Caesar always told me.[A][ClearBox]Fallible compassion and[Pause=3] allies who try to
take advantage of us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
are things we must steer clear of.[A][ClearBox]We're mercenaries,[Pause=3]
we can't afford trusting people.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]But [SpecialText0x14=0x39], you're special.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Raddy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Please don't tell anyone.[Pause=3]
I only told you because it's you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, got it.[Pause=3]

even though you're a knight?[A][ClearBox]Can't you just leave it to an underlin'?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, you see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I want to learn how to do it properly.[A][ClearBox]Besides, there's no superior or subordinate
when it comes to cookery.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Heh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I thought all knights liked bossin' us around,
but I see there[Pause=3] are some like you, too.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh?

they were pleasantly surprised[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Though I told them the truth straightaway.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You didn't hafta.[Pause=3]
You did most of the work anyway, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Nonetheless[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Thank you so much for your assistance.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I-I didn't do it for your sake, see.[A][ClearBox]It's just that I'm good[Pause=3] with my fingers,
so I can do things a knight can't.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed.
Sir Ricardo, I'd love it if you could teach

I'm sorry for the trouble.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's no trouble at all.[A][ClearBox]Your daily growth always enthralls me,

That's wonderful[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The children there grow stronger with every

I did tell you about that, didn't I?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Could you tell me a bit more about it,
if you don't mind?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Alright.[A][ClearBox]There's a bountiful sea near the monastery.[Pause=3]
The children often go play there.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sounds fun.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
But since they're so energetic[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
they injure themselves often.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hmm[Pause=1] and that's when you heal them with
your staff, right Sir Riff?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I don't do that.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Pardon?[Pause=3]
Why not[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Why are you befuddled, lass?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]People are born with the power of healing
their own wounds.[A][ClearBox]A staff's power is merely a supplement
to that natural healing.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]And, besides, children need to learn
that getting hurt is dangerous[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That is what I humbly believe.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I agree with you too.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's why I only heal them when it's
absolutely required.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sir Riff.[Pause=3]

[SpecialText0x14=0x39], your eyes are kinda scary[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]You sure you're not angry?[Pause=3]
'Cause you look really angry.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Teehee, why would I be angry[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Come over here[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]D-don't hurt me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Gaaaaah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Hmm?
What is this? It smells heavenly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SHEEDA][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh my, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
What good timing.[A][ClearBox]I tried to make stew with some leftovers.[Pause=3]
Would you like to try some?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Princess Sheeda, you've been cooking?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
I do hope Marth enjoys what I've made.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, that is nice of you.[A][ClearBox]Then, if you'll allow me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]Ah![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's delicious[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It tastes really good.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm glad you like it.[Pause=3]
Do you think Marth will like it too?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Without a shadow of a doubt.[Pause=3]
It's delicious, after all.[A][ClearBox]Though you're the princess of Talis,[Pause=3]
you're awfully skilled at cooking[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, I may be a princess, but[Pause=3]
my motherland Talis is just a small
island nation surrounded by the sea.[A][ClearBox]I played around outside a lot during
my childhood days.[Pause=3]
I hear they often called me a tomboy.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_C_2
[TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I never would have guessed.[A][ClearBox]Oh, by the way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Some time ago, you were our[Pause=3] opponent during
our training, Princess.[A][ClearBox]I could scarcely believe a princess would
fight us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I still remember[Pause=3] my amazement
at the time.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh yes.[Pause=3]
That time, everyone begged me to quit, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I suppose I[Pause=3] truly am a tomboy, after all?[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Oh, a heavenly smell again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Princess Sheeda, are you cooking again?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SHEEDA][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes.
Today, I made candy.[A][ClearBox]I was thinking of sharing some with everyone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Here. This is for you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Thank you.
Such an elaborately-crafted candy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'm sure Prince Marth will be touched, too.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Heehee, thanks.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Maybe I should learn how to cook, too.[A][ClearBox]If I could cook as well as you, Princess,
then perhaps I could become a bit more
lady-like, maybe[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Are you bad at cooking, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Sadly, yes.[Pause=3]
My grandfather told me when I was a child[Pause=3]
that my cooking tasted like steel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh my gosh.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_B_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]Many times I'd attempt to cook, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Grandfather always stopped me.[A][ClearBox]When I told him I would become the world's
strongest,[Pause=3] he'd tell me:[Pause=3]
"I'm sure you can do it."[A][ClearBox]But when I said I wanted to make dinner,[Pause=3]
he'd say:[A][ClearBox]"If you must insist,[Pause=3] then you must strike
me down first"[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] just like that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh my.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Since I was raised[Pause=3] like a boy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I don't know how to anything girly.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]But, I think it'd be wonderful if I could
make candies and share them with others
as presents[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Gosh.[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], don't tell me[Pause=3] you have eyes
for someone?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]N-no,[Pause=3] there's no such person[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You don't need to be embarrassed.[Pause=3]
We're both girls, remember.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Eh-heh, I'm no good with this sort of thing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Princess Sheeda,[Pause=3] it smells good.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SHEEDA][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, then it should be done already.[Pause=3]
Could you please open it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wow[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Amazing, I can't believe I made this candy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's very well done,[Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Come, let's taste it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then, I shall have one.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
This is, how should I say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]W-what is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][SpecialText0x14=0x39], don't worry about this.[A][ClearBox]I believe[Pause=3] people mature by[Pause=3]
repeating mistakes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]You don't need to be so polite.[Pause=3]
You can just say it's bad[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]D-does it really taste like steel[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]A-a little.[Pause=3]
No, perhaps not just a little, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F64][FaceCommand=0x73]It's alright, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
I'm sure you'll do it well someday.[A][ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_PEACEFUL1][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, I'll do my best.[A][ClearBox]You have my thanks,[Pause=3] Princess.[A][ClearBox]It brings me great joy[Pause=3] learning from
somebody like you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Your thanks is undeserved.
I, too, enjoy[Pause=3] the time I spend with you.[A][ClearBox]You may put up a serious front, but you
can be rather cute in your own way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I like you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Princess[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Say, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Stay my friend forever.[A][ClearBox]Someday,[Pause=3]
when this war is over and peace returns[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend our
time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] like this, the three of us[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Truly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_WOLEN_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WOLLEN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Oh, Warren. Where did you go?[Pause=3]
I haven't seen you around for a while[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]To the forest.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Forest?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm a hunter, after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]Huh?
C-could you come back here?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WOLLEN][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Huh, oh sorry.[Pause=3]
You weren't finished speaking[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I'm glad you understand.[Pause=3]
I thought you didn't like me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Nah.[A][ClearBox]It's just that I'm used to being alone.[Pause=3]
I'm not good at talking[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I see.[Pause=3]
But, I heard you're acquaintanced with
Dame Katua?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] A long time ago,[Pause=3] I treated Katua's
pegasus after an accident.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see, so that's how you met[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ec]Dame Katua told me.[Pause=3]
That you're a blunt, but gentle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ed]Wait, what?[Pause=3]
He's gone again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oh dear,[Pause=3] does he not like me after all[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_WOLEN_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WOLLEN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Hello, Warren.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, so it's you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Can we talk like before?[Pause=3]
I want to know more about you.[Pause=3]
We're comrades-in-arms, after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sure, I don't mind.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You said you're a hunter.[Pause=3]
So, how is a hunter's life?[A][ClearBox]I'm from the countryside as well,[Pause=3]
but I spent all my time training with
my grandfather[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Y-you don't like talking to me, do you?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Nah, that ain't it.[Pause=3]
Sorry for giving you the wrong idea.[A][ClearBox]But,[Pause=3] I'm not used to talking.[Pause=3]
I dunno how to start[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]For instance, did you always hunt alone?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, always alone.[A][ClearBox]I'd hunt small game in the forest,[Pause=3]
but sometimes I'd ascend the snowy
mountains to catch the big ones[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]If a blizzard came, I'd dig a hole and
wait there until it stopped snowing.[Pause=3]
For days even[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What did you do to pass the time?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Nothing at all.[Pause=3]
Just wait.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Staying alone, doing nothing for days[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I don't think I'd be able to stand that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's because I'm used to being alone.[Pause=3]
My usual life is like that too.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Don't you have a family?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Nope. I live alone in the forest.[A][ClearBox]I hunt what I need in the forest,[Pause=3]
and live in a hut deep inside.[A][ClearBox]If there isn't any business[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I spend years without seeing anyone.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But, don't you feel lonely?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Katua asked me that too, back then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But I don't really know[Pause=3]
what feeling lonely means.[A][ClearBox]I've been alone as far as I remember.[Pause=3]
Being alone was a given.[Pause=3]
So, I never felt anything about it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Even if everyone else disappeared
from this world[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It wouldn't change a thing for me.[A][ClearBox]And on the other hand, if I were to
disappear from this world[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] It wouldn't
change a thing for the world, either.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You're mistaken, Warren.[A][ClearBox]We're comrades.[Pause=3]
If you were to disappear,[Pause=3] I would be sad.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So,[Pause=3] don't disappear suddenly.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Don't worry.[Pause=3]
I don't plan to.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_WOLEN_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WOLLEN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Warren,[Pause=3] what are your plans
when this war is over?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Same as before.[Pause=3]
Live as a hunter.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
My feelings might[Pause=3] have changed.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight]Huh?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][Pause=3][Music=BGM_EVT_LOVE2]It's something I've never felt before[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I feel like I'll have a hard time[Pause=3] parting with
you once this war ends.[A][ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] I want to talk to you again.[Pause=3]
That's how I feel.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Warren[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]We stuck together for a long time.[A][ClearBox]I believe I've gotten to know[Pause=3] why people
feel lonely.[A][ClearBox]People don't feel lonely because they're
alone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] but because they've become alone.[A][ClearBox]Parting from a precious companion feels
lonely.[Pause=3] That's what I've learned[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Warren[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Then we should definitely meet again.[A][ClearBox]After this war is over.[Pause=3]
Let us meet again and again.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] let's.[A][ClearBox][X]

Can you tell me what happened?[Pause=3]
Don't tell me the enemy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]N-no, that isn't it.[Pause=3]
It's just that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I get scared when I think[Pause=3] of battle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And when I remember I'll have to step in the
battlefield again,[Pause=3] I can't stop trembling[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Prince Yubello[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Y-you see,[Pause=3]
I have never been in a battle before[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]I'm scared.[Pause=3]
Of battle, of dying[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm very, very scared[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Prince Yubello,[Pause=3] everyone fears death.[Pause=3]
There is no shame in that.[A][ClearBox]Stay by my side from now on.[Pause=3]
If we fight together,[Pause=3] we'll reassure each
other.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]Y-yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Thanks.[A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=YUBELLO][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Say, why are you so strong, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Me, strong?[Pause=3]
No, I'm still far from strong[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]But, from my viewpoint,[Pause=3]
you're amazingly strong, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]And not only strong in battle,[Pause=3]
but in heart, too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]In heart?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]We're at war, right?[Pause=3]
We might suddenly die in the battlefield
tomorrow[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And yet,[Pause=3] you're fighting bravely, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]How can I[Pause=3] become strong like you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]People grow stronger[Pause=3] when they have
something to protect.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Something to protect[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
I am one of Prince Marth's Royal Guards.[Pause=3]
My duty is to protect him.[A][ClearBox]If it's to protect him,[Pause=3] I'll fear no battle.[A][ClearBox]This strength isn't just mine,[Pause=3] I can become
strong because[Pause=3] Prince Marth is there.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Do you have[Pause=3] someone you want
to protect, Prince Yubello?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Me?[A][ClearBox]Who do I want to protect[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

Are you practising today, as well?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh yes.[Pause=3]
Since my body is weak,[Pause=3] I need to make more
effort than the others.[A][ClearBox]The training routine you've taught me[Pause=3]
is really strict, [SpecialText0x14=0x39], but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Don't force yourself too much.[Pause=3]
It'll hinder you in battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, thank you.[A][ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] I'm not afraid anymore.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Prince Yubello[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course, I'd be lying if I said
I'm not afraid of battle at all, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]More importantly,[Pause=3] I want to become stronger.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Until now,[Pause=3] I couldn't do anything by myself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've always been relying on someone else.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Lawrence, Yumina, Oguma, and you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I was just being protected by everyone.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]I want to become able[Pause=3] to live on
even if everyone is gone.[A][ClearBox]I want to become much stronger[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I want to protect those who protected me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]A wise decision, Prince Yubello.[Pause=3]
You've become strong.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks.[Pause=3]
It's all thanks to you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]I'll keep on doing my best from now on[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]
