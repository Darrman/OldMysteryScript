[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=TIKI][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BANUTU][FaceCommand=0x73]Chiki, my child.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh,[Pause=3] Ban-Ban[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Are you having a[Pause=2] fun time with everyone?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm having so,[Pause=2] so much fun[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ooh,[Pause=1] that's good to hear.[Pause=3]
It's very important you're having fun.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh,[Pause=2] but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm?[Pause=3]
Is something the matter,[Pause=1] child?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]A while I ago,[Pause=3] I, umm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I broke Mar-Mar's precious[Pause=2] mirror[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]...[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh dear[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
That's[Pause=2] a bad thing you did.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Yes.[Pause=3]
I did something bad[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So,[Pause=3] what did you do after that, child?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_BANUTU_TIKI_C_2
[TargetRight]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2][EyeCommand=ed] Mmm.[A][ClearBox]I told him.[Pause=3]
I said "I'm sorry"[Pause=2] to Mar-Mar.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And then,[Pause=3] Prince Marth forgave you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I see, I see.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Good, good[Pause=3]
You're a good girl,[Pause=1] Chiki.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Huh[EyeCommand=ed]?[Pause=3]
I'm[Pause=1] a good girl?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]And if I'm a good girl,[Pause=3] [FaceCommand=0x73]I can live together
with everyone?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Of course you can, child.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Really[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
Then,[Pause=1] I'll[Pause=2] stay a good girl[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's good of you.[A]
In that case,[Pause=1] I'll be relieved, too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=TIKI][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BANUTU][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So,[Pause=1] afterwards[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
We'll[Pause=2] live together[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
Me and Mar-Mar.[A][ClearBox]And of course,[Pause=3] Ban-Ban too[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Hoho,[Pause=1] sounds like we'll be one busy family.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]By the way,[Pause=1] Chiki.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What is it,[Pause=3] Ban-Ban?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Have you[Pause=1] had those dreams as of late?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Dreams[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]No[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]I haven't had those scary dreams anymore.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Splendid.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh,[Pause=2] that's right[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I saw you[Pause=3] in my dream last night, Ban-Ban[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]You were in your human form[Pause=3] and yet you
were [Pause=1]sooo big![A][ClearBox]I rode[Pause=1] on your back[Pause=2] and waved my hand to
everyone[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see,[Pause=1] I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
Sounds like a fun dream.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
It was[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] fun[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh,[Pause=1] child,[Pause=3] I see it's your bedtime already.[A]
[FaceCommand=0x73]Time for you to return to your room.[A][ClearBox]But, will you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] be alright alone?[A][ClearBox]There's something[Pause=1] I have to do.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]Yes[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I[Pause=1] can go[Pause=2] back myself.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F32][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=eh][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth][A]
I wonder[Pause=3] if it's about time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BANUTU_TIKI_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=TIKI][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BANUTU][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Chiki, my child.[Pause=3]
Listen well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=1] What is it,[Pause=3] Ban-Ban?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]In this world,[Pause=3] there are many dragonkin[Pause=1] like
ourselves.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=eh]And among them,[Pause=1] there are those who are[Pause=3]
suffering, alone.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Just like[Pause=3] I used to be?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Yes, child.[A][ClearBox]That's why[Pause=3] I've been thinking of going to
meet them.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?[Pause=3]
Then, me too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]This will be[Pause=3] a most perilous journey.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=eh]Ever since the Mediuth episode,[Pause=3] man has
started to view[Pause=1] us Manaketes as dangerous.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]And therefore,[Pause=3] no matter the reason, we
must not wield our dragonstone.[A][ClearBox]So,[Pause=3] we have no choice but to[Pause=3] stand between
man and Manakete.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Chiki,[Pause=1] once this war is over[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'll arrange it so
you'll live in Pales town.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]No[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][EyeCommand=ed][Pause=2] I don't wanna.[A]
I want to stay with you, Ban-Ban[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Besides, you promised, remember![A][ClearBox]Once this war is over, you promised[Pause=3] we'd go
shopping together,[Pause=3] and you'd cook for me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_BANUTU_TIKI_A_2
[TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm terribly sorry, child.[A]
Your Ban-Ban is[Pause=3] a naughty boy.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]That's not fair[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm going with you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]It isn't like[Pause=3] we'll be apart forever.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]That's right.[Pause=3]
I'm sure I'll be back[Pause=3] when you're a bit taller.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Huh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[EyeCommand=ed]How tall?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hmm?[Pause=3]
I guess[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] about my height.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Okay[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[EyeCommand=ed]Then,[Pause=1] I'll transform and[Pause=3] become bigger right
now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]W-wait,[Pause=3] Chiki[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sorry,[Pause=3] I lied.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Heavens above.[Pause=3]
[EyeCommand=ed]Don't startle me like that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm sorry,[Pause=3] Ban-Ban[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=eh]You were afraid of being alone, weren't you?[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]I'm sorry.[Pause=3]
This is something only I can do[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Will you be able to cope?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Uh-huh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] It's okay.[Pause=3]
[EyeCommand=ed]I have everyone with me.[A][ClearBox]Besides,[FaceCommand=0x73] I'm a[Pause=3] good girl[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_GOHDON_LIAN_C
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LIAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Brother[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=GOHDON]Hey, Ryan.[Pause=3]
Whoa[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] It seems you've grown taller since I
last saw you at home.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Not only am I now taller, my skill with the bow
has improved as well![Pause=3] Though my hand kinda
hurts.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hmm?[Pause=3]
Yikes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] That's got to hurt.
We need to apply some medicine.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah.[Pause=3]
But Brother, your hands used to be like this,
too.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Not as much now.[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But if your hands hurt too much, you might
not be able to hold a bow straight.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, I have been training every day[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Plus, that bow might not be suited to you.[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Alright, then let's train together again.
I'll see what the problem is.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]S-sorry for being a pain[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, but you've become much better compared
to before. I was surprised when I saw you
fighting earlier.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]Ah![UnfreezeMouth]
Were you watching?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I was in a position that allowed me to
watch you. Although, watching you made me a
little anxious.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]In that case, I'll have to train harder so,
next time, you'll be able to watch me without
worrying[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_GOHDON_LIAN_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=GOHDON][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LIAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Hey, Ryan.
Have you seen [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39]?
She was here until a moment ago.[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]!!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]She doesn't seem to be around.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ryan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You've become stronger.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Why do you say that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Before, you'd never shout for anything.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I think you should thank everyone in the
7th Platoon.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Sounds likely.[A][ClearBox]Then, perhaps I should have you make a
speech in front of everyone?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What!?[Pause=3] I-I'm not ready for something like that
yet.[A][ClearBox]If it's a speech you want, ask [SpecialText0x14=0x39],
not me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ahaha, I see.
So that's still hard for you.[A][ClearBox]Though I'm no good at making speeches either.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't make me do what you can't, Brother[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But I think that alone should allow me to
write a good reply.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What reply?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Mother was worried about you, so she sent
me a lettter.[A][ClearBox]I think it'd sound better if I could say you
made a public speech, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]Wha-![UnfreezeMouth]
Err, I'll go look for [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_GOHDON_LIAN_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=GOHDON][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LIAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Your hand should be fine now though it might
hurt a bit to hold a bow, for a while.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thanks, but I wonder if I've gotten as good
as you now, Brother?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed. If we leave the experience in, er, odd
battlefields aside, you might be even better[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What? You're exaggerating.
And who was it that saved me in earlier
battles[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]And you did the same for me.
Ryan, you're already a veteran knight.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Brother[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I volunteered to be an Aritian knight
because I was watching your back, following
your steps.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And that's why it makes me happy to hear
that kind of praise from you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I feel awkward if you say it that openly.[A][ClearBox]But Ryan, I hear a weapon user shouldn't
show the palm of his hand to others.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Why is that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]By looking at the thickness of one's hand
and fingers, one's blisters and calluses,[A][ClearBox]one's habits and ability can be deduced.[A][ClearBox]It's the same as showing your hand to the
enemy.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Wow[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
In that case, we need gloves to battle, right?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You needn't go that far[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
There aren't many who can tell all that just
by seeing your hand.[A][ClearBox]I know I can't.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, then we'll know which of us is better if
we ask someone who can![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But if I were told that you're better than me
now, I think I'd feel depressed.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I think I'll go train.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_KATARINA_CECIL_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=KATARINA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Cecil.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Long time no see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Katarina.
How dare you come waltzing back as if
nothing happened.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm sorry.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetLeft]Prince Marth and [SpecialText0x14=0x39] are too kind,
so they might really have forgiven you.[A][ClearBox]But I'm different.[A][ClearBox]Even if you say you've reformed, I can't just
simply trust you, not after you betrayed all
of us.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]
I know[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
With everything I've done, yours would be
anyone's natural reaction.[A][ClearBox]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] there's one thing I'd like you to believe.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]And that would be?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]When I was in the 7th Platoon[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Both my laughter and the peace I felt were
real.[A][ClearBox]As was my friendship with you, Cecil.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I've already forgotten my friendship with
you.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Then it seems I have no choice but to regain
your trust through my actions from now.[A][ClearBox]Cecil[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I truly hope we'll someday be able to
talk and laugh together, like we used to.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.
In that case, I'll be watching you battle, from
behind.[A][ClearBox]I'll know right away if you ease up.
Prepare yourself.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_KATARINA_CECIL_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=KATARINA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Katarina[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Show me your leg.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Cecil[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][Music=BGM_EVT_PEACEFUL1][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]There's blood, as I thought.
You were hiding the wound you suffered in
battle, weren't you?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm sorry. I thought I wouldn't be allowed in
the front lines if they found out I was
wounded.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]If you leave your wound be, you'll become
unable to walk.[A][ClearBox]I'll stand guard today, so go get your wound
treated and get some rest.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But I have to fight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Until you can accept me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I already accept you.
There's no way I'd doubt a girl who has come
this far.[A][ClearBox]It's painfully clear that you're working hard
to atone for your sins, from the bottom of
your heart.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Really?
Thank you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, so[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You can go rest already.
I can't stand watching you like this[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_KATARINA_CECIL_B_2
[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] for making you worry.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I don't want to hear you apologize.[Pause=3]
I want us to make up. Look, everything is now
the way it was before.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It's not that simple[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
There are others who still doubt me.[A][ClearBox]Until I have regained everyone's trust, I must
continue to fight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth]
Who on earth doesn't trust you, Katarina[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Don't worry. I'll beat up everybody who
doesn't.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Beat them up[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Teehee.
You really haven't changed, Cecil.[A][ClearBox]Once your mind is made up, you always
charge in a straight line.
You're so reliable[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]See, now you're laughing.[A][ClearBox]That's more like it. If you don't relax your
shoulder like that, you won't be able to use
your full strength.[A][ClearBox]Don't worry about those who judge you.
Just go back to how you used to be.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes.[Pause=3]
Thank you very much, Cecil.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_KATARINA_CECIL_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=KATARINA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I saw that, Katarina![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?
What?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're really easy to read, you know.[A][ClearBox]After all, you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] were always looking at that
one person.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Oh, [Pause=3]err[Pause=3], ah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=5] Please[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Don't tell anyone[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm, what should I do?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Please[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If that person were to know[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Wait, don't cry[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I joke, I joke.[Pause=3]
I don't like spreading rumors.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Phew.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Teehee.[Pause=3]
But talking like this really takes me back.[A][ClearBox]Those times we had, when training to be
knights[Pause=3] with [SpecialText0x14=0x39] and the others[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Isn't it just so nostalgic?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_KATARINA_CECIL_A_2
[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I completely agree[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]But, back then, I betrayed everyone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]W-wait, don't cry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You hear me, Katarina?[Pause=3]
Remember this reeeeally well.[A][ClearBox]No matter what happened thus far, and no
matter what happens from now on[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]We are friends.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Cecil[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Uhh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sob[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]W-wait, don't start crying again[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Oh please. Just what should I do with you[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm just[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] so happy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] sniff[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_KATUA_EST_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=KATUA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EST][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Sister[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I got a gift for you today.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x7]Wow, thanks.
What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]A lance that brings luck.[Pause=3]
I heard it brings good fortune when you
smash enemies with it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Are you sure it's not cursed[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No way! Everyone who used this lance got a
promotion, a lover, money, stuff like that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sounds shady[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Luck is something you grasp with your own
strength, not something that requires trifles
like this.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Don't you want it[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
And to think I bought it from the shop just
for you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I guess it can't be helped.
Alright, I'll have it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Hey, you're not faking that unwillingness and
going to secretly use it, right[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]I won't use it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hmmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Oh dear, I don't think this'll sell if I put it on
the counter like this[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Hey, Katua, what do you think of this?
This is the latest lance model.
It has a sword and an axe on its tip[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Est, stop bringing me prototypes and
expecting me to evaluate them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_KATUA_EST_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=KATUA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EST][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Est[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
There's something I've been wanting to ask
you for a while, can I?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I heard you started a shop with Abel, and
that you were even selling weapons[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Did you make a proper living from stocking
whatever you could get your hands on?[A][ClearBox]Since it's you, I was worried that you might
have started it on a whim.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]It wasn't on a whim. Besides, since we're
always using weapons in combat, I'm sure we
have an eye for their quality.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Well, that could be true indeed, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]And since we have connections with the
Macedonian and Aritian armies, we don't
have to worry about customers.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh yes.
Both of you used to be in the army.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Plus, even legendary weapons break after
being used long enough, so there's never a
lack of demand.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's not all! I can carry them with my

either[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Katua? Are you alright?
You look like you're in shock[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
You appear unreliable, but you're steadier
than I thought.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]No way.
I'm always relying on you and the others to
pull me from danger.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]And that makes me think that perhaps, you
just really know how to swim with the tide[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

I'm sorry, Est[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Are you hurt?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]No worries; it's just a graze.
But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] You're kinda scary today, Katua.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is that right[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Maybe I'm taking today's practice too
seriously.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Let's stop for today.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Katua[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Tell me straight.
Do you hate me now?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What? Never.
What are you babbling about?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Today[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] it really felt like you were trying to
crush your resentment by force[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Hey, if there's anything you don't like, let me

unbearable feeling in my chest[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]and I just get so angry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I despise myself for feeling like this[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]You haven't done anything wrong.
It's just that my heart is weak[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Ah, aaah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
You deceived me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I'm not gonna cry forever.[Pause=3]
It's your fault for being mean, Katua.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm sorry.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I forgive you.[Pause=3]
However, only if you tell me his name.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]W-w-what[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't play dumb.
You're terrible at lying, Katua.[A][ClearBox]I can give you advice.

[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RINDA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Huh?
Where's my magic tome[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I was sure I left it here.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICH]Sorry,[Pause=1] Linda.
I borrowed it for a bit.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Aha, that makes sense.[Pause=3]
But, you do know that magic tome can only
be used by women, right?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's why I borrowed it.
As I thought, I couldn't use it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2]
How strange. I wonder why?[A][ClearBox]Your father[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] Archbishop Miroa was able to
wield Aura, right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Father once told me.[A][ClearBox]Advanced tomes have restrictions on who
can use them, based on who created and 
inherited them.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.[Pause=2] So you mean to say the condition to
use a magic tome isn't necessarily just
gender.[A][ClearBox]I wonder how these user restrictions are set
into place[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]There are many things about magic that
remain unexplained.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]It seems the more you learn about magic, the
less you understand it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed.[Pause=3] I've been studying magic for a long as
I remember, but all the answers I find lead to
more questions.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh right. If you're interested, there's
something I'd like you to read.[Pause=3] Well, it's an
unfinished thesis, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Wow[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] You're writing a thesis?[Pause=3]
[FaceCommand=0x73]You really study hard, Marich.
Of course I'd like to read it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Great.[Pause=3]
Don't forget to tell me what you think about
it, later.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MARICH_RINDA_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICH][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RINDA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Say, why did you decide to become a mage,
Marich?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why do you ask?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Isn't Aritia well-known for its court knights?[A][ClearBox]Even in Pales, mages from Aritia were
quite rare.[A][ClearBox]Besides, I hear you're an Aritian noble.
Didn't you consider becoming a knight?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Well, I've always preferred reading books
over exercising my body.[A][ClearBox]Many around me expected me to become a
knight, so I heard all sorts of things when I
decided to study in Khadein[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But, Prince Marth and Princess Ellis were
different.[Pause=3] They supported my dream of
becoming a mage.[A][ClearBox]I might have given up if not for them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][Pause=3][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So that's why[Pause=3] you and Prince Marth are so
close.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, Prince Marth really saved me.[A][ClearBox]If what I've learned so far might be of use
to him, then I'll follow him anywhere,[Pause=2] anytime.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MARICH_RINDA_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICH][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RINDA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Hello, Marich[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Oh, what's that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] This is a charm that Princess Ellis
gave me when I went to study in Khadein.[A][ClearBox]She said it'd bring me good luck.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Princess Ellis[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm sorry that had to happen.[Pause=3]
I just hope that she's safe.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Princess Ellis is very kind.[A][ClearBox]In the previous war, she sacrificed her own
safety to save Prince Marth.
And in this war, she[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm sure she's alright, Marich.[Pause=3]
Don't look so depressed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sorry, I made you worry.[Pause=3]
Princess Ellis is special to me, so I can't
control myself sometimes.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Special[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What's wrong, Linda?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]No, it's nothing.[Pause=3]
Come on, cheer up.[A][ClearBox]You're only going to drag your performance
down in this state.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]
Thank you, Linda.[Pause=2] You're right[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2]
Worrying will get me nowhere.
All I can do now is to walk forward.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_EST_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EST][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Commander, this is the Angel Ring I was
talking about[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] or rather, its replica.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you, Est.[A][ClearBox]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's completely different from the art of
our continent.[A][ClearBox]Regardless, it's a beautiful ring[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Traveling beyond the sea was troublesome in
many ways, but it was a good experience
nonetheless.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Your stories about your travels never fail
to delight me, but seeing the ring before me
delights me in another way.[A][ClearBox]Why don't you add it to your shop's stock?
I'm sure it would sell well.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I bet it would too, but trouble is I don't know
how to manufacture it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]In other words, that's the only one I have.
[FaceCommand=0x73]But, you can have it if you want.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]It's such a precious item[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Are you certain?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] If you were to wear it,
Commander, the effort made to create it
would be well and truly rewarded.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_EST_C_2
[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Then, I'll gladly accept it.
I'll treasure it dearly.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Seeing you so interested really makes me
want to take you there, Commander.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Haha, sounds fun.[Pause=3]
But that's an impossible dream.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F32][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth] Why do you say that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_GRAVE1][FaceCommand=0x61]My choices and actions thus far[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
And the sins towards my people and my
soldiers that I must atone for[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]When I think of those, I simply cannot allow
myself to live freely and seek happiness.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]My intention is to devote my entire life to
the people of Macedonia.[A][ClearBox]Just looking at this ring and dreaming of a
land overseas is well enough for me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] That's just too cruel, Commander[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, not at all.[Pause=3]
Thank you, Est.
This ring shall be my treasure.[A][ClearBox]And you: please live a happy and content life.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Commander[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_EST_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EST][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Commander.[Pause=3]
There's something I'd like to ask you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Err[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] Do you, um, hold anyone in your heart,
Commander?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You mean like a crush?[Pause=3]
No.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] Th-that's too bad.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Why?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Commander, sometimes you look really sad.[A][ClearBox]I've been thinking if there was a good way to
heal your sadness, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed, you've obtained great happiness by
finding yourself a good husband.[A][ClearBox]If I were to establish such a bond with
someone, I wonder how much happier I'd be.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Y-you think so too?[Pause=3]
In that case[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] May I ask?[A][ClearBox]Is there anyone in the Aritian army that you
have your eyes on, Commander?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Haha, there are certainly gentlemen I
appreciate, but to call it love would be[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Besides, I haven't the time to seek my own
happiness.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No way[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Aren't you being a little too hard on
yourself, Commander[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Est[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What am I saying[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Please forgive me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]It's fine.[Pause=3]
I know you say such words because you care
about me.[A][ClearBox]Est[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'll give some thought to these words of
yours.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_EST_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EST][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Est, what's wrong?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I wonder if I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It feels like you've lost all motivation.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]When I look at everyone, it makes me feel
like I'm a burden[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is that so?[Pause=3]
Doesn't seem that way to me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]My body has grown dull since I left the army,
and I've never been as strong as my sisters
anyway[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]You're gravely mistaken.[A][ClearBox]It's true that valor is important, but that
isn't the only thing that dictates the flow of
battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Huh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If that's true, then what's most important?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]The most important thing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] is teamwork.[A][ClearBox]You three sisters should understand this
better than anyone else.[A][ClearBox]That mysterious ultimate attack that can only
be launched if all three of you are there[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]I'm certain you three are the only ones who
can perform it.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Do you understand now?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The Whitewings are my pride.
You should be proud, as well.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Y-yes[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]And now I must work.
Will you accompany me in my training?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Gladly[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_KATUA_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATUA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Good[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It seems this armor and lance are still going
to last.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]You sure are earnest about your arms
maintenance, Katua.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course.[Pause=3]
They're precious items I received from you,
Commander.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]It's okay to hold them dear, but you can't
afford to have them break during battle.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Try not to get too attached to them.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, Commander, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] I can't help but to be
drawn to this armor.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The Whitewing armor. I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]For a long time, the Whitewings lived in the
shadows of the gallant Dragoons.[A][ClearBox]Commander, it was thanks to your proposal
to the king that they were restored.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]I honestly can't thank you enough.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]All I did was argue about the pegasi's
superior resistance and mobility compared
to wyverns.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]It was the three of you who used the few
chances you had to prove the Whitewings'
prowess.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]We only had those opportunities thanks to
you as well, Commander.[A][ClearBox]And in this war too, I plan to make the
Whitewings' prowess known throughout the
entire world.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.[A][ClearBox]I believe your mobility is going to be pivotal in
this war as well. I have high hopes for you,
Katua.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_KATUA_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATUA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Good, good[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I know I'm pushing you too far.[A][ClearBox]But the war isn't over yet.
Please lend me your strength for a little
while longer.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Taking care of your wyvern, Commander?
If you're just talking to it, then I could do it
in your place.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, this is something I must do myself.[A][ClearBox]We can't fight properly during battle[Pause=3] if there
isn't trust between rider and wyvern, after
all.[A][ClearBox]It's just like pegasus training.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But you're well-informed, if you know about
pegasus training.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's because I used to be a pegasus rider,
myself.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Is that true?
I honestly had no idea.
[FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What's wrong?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Commander, why did you switch from a
pegasus to a wyvern?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Are you curious?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_KATUA_B_2
[TargetLeft]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2]
Forgive me. Have I asked too much?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I don't mind.
It isn't such a private matter.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]To put it simply[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I had to, to become stronger.[A][ClearBox]Macedonia isn't a large kingdom.[A][ClearBox]And there's only one reason it's recognized
by other kingdoms as an independent nation:[A][ClearBox]Because of its legion of dragon knights.[A][ClearBox]So, to symbolize Macedonia's might, those of
House Macedonia must ride wyverns[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And that's why I released my pegasus into
the forest and took a Wyvern Whip.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So that's what happened[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I wonder if the pegasus I befriended is still in
Macedonia's forests[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Once this war is over and peace returns,
I'd like to go see how he's faring.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]It's almost time for the war council already.
I'm going ahead, Katua.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]Commander is truly a gentle, peace-loving
soul[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I wonder if the white wings of a pegasus
would truly be best suited for her[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_KATUA_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATUA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]So, how did you like riding astride my
pegasus?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I had a most enjoyable time.
Thank you, Katua.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Your joy honors me, Commander.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The wind felt so soft from your pegasus[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]From my wyvern, the wind is almost like a
cutting edge.[A][ClearBox]It felt like it softened my battle-hardened
heart a little.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Please ask me again anytime, if I'm worthy.[Pause=3]
[FaceCommand=0x61]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You'd probably feel far more at ease if you
were to straddle the pegasus you left in the
forest.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You're too kind, Katua.[A][ClearBox]But indeed, I look forward to the day when I
can be enveloped by a soft wind alongside
you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'll help to the best of my limited ability
so that day will arrive as soon as possible.[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MINERBA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=PAORA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Do you have a moment, Commander?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Paola[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] Is something the matter?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I wonder if I could receive some training from
you?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is there a special reason? A knight of your
caliber should have no need for any training
I could give.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I am[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] ashamed by my own weakness.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]It feels as though the feelings hidden deep
within my chest could leak out any moment[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]and it frightens me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][Pause=3][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I understand.
I shall inquire no further.[A][ClearBox]I have only just accepted what part of me I
should cast away, myself.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Let us spar, for the first time in a long while.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you.[Pause=3]
Then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Here I come[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Though we're training, don't hold back.[Pause=3]
Cast the shadows of your heart onto your

Training again?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, that was my plan, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I shall refrain for today.[A][ClearBox]But more importantly, Commander.
What were you pondering about, just now?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I am sad to say, my own inexperience
shames me.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]In the previous war, we of House Macedonia
fought among ourselves and led the kingdom
into disarray.[A][ClearBox]And this time, again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I lacked the strength to bring order to the
kingdom,[Pause=3] and thus allowed the fires of
rebellion to burn.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]But that's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It is fine.[A][ClearBox]I know I force many troubles upon you, too.
Forgive me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Commander[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2]
If you commit a mistake, isn't it enough to
simply correct it?[A][ClearBox]During your reign...[Pause=3]
I joined your side because I believed in your
ideal.[A][ClearBox]And even now, I'll continue to fight by your
side, with the best of my limited abilities.[A][ClearBox]So please, please raise your head.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Thank you, Paola.[Pause=3]
Your words bring me comfort.[A][ClearBox]In order to rebuild our homeland as soon as

What will become of the Kingdom of Macedonia
now?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I do not know.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Commander[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm sorry.
I was irresponsible with my words.[A][ClearBox]But, I want to be honest with you.[A][ClearBox]Our kingdom of Macedonia is now at a turning
point, just like the day when it was founded
by Iote.[A][ClearBox]The many wars and rebellions have left scars
on the people and the land, and one who can
truly lead them is needed.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then, Commander, you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I have thought long and hard about this.[A][ClearBox]Whether I could really be called the ideal
choice.[A][ClearBox]I couldn't govern as well as I could handle a
spear.[A][ClearBox]I believe it's time I accepted my own
powerlessness.[A][ClearBox]Perhaps my true duty is to help draw this
war to a close as soon as possible, and then
retire.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MINERBA_PAORA_A_2
[TargetLeft]Are you saying you'll abandon your country?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]There's no way I could do that.
I love Macedonia.[A][ClearBox]If it's within my abilities, I'll do anything and
everything for it.[A][ClearBox]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I believe new blood is needed for a
new future.[A][ClearBox]In order to truly restore our beautiful
homeland, we must breathe some new life onto
it.[A][ClearBox]And for that purpose, the old blood[SpecialSymbol=0x96]the
royal family I'm part of[SpecialSymbol=0x96]must be weeded out.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So you're prepared to go that far[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I haven't told anybody else about this yet.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then, why tell something so important to a
person like me?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Heh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] That, too, is my weakness.

Were you watching?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see hesitation in your swings.
Were you always this weak?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]If I'm hesitating[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] it's because of you,
Brother.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh?[Pause=3]
So I'm an eyesore am I?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's not it.

Maria saved my life and I do not intend to
waste her efforts by throwing it away.[A][ClearBox]You ask what I'm seeking?[Pause=3]
That should be obvious.[A][ClearBox]I haven't abandoned my ambitions.[Pause=3]
Assuredly I'll fight with you again, for the

Can't we just hold our hands and walk the
same path together, as siblings?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Nonsense.[Pause=3] We carry the blood of warriors in
our veins[SpecialSymbol=0x96]only on the battlefield can we find
our true selves.[A][ClearBox]It is inevitable that we should clash with each

hesitate for a second.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]Oh, Brother[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]The blood of warriors,[Pause=3] you say?
Perhaps you speak the truth.[A][ClearBox]But Maria is diffferent.[Pause=3]
Both you and I seek the light she radiates.[A][ClearBox]The peaceful Macedonia I wish for, and the
mighty Macedonia you seek[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I know we can
accomplish both.[A][ClearBox]Maria might just be the link between the two

It'd a shame to leave it like that.[A][ClearBox]Leave it to me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've got tons of cute hairdos in mind![A][ClearBox]I have to repay you for saving my life, don't

I see right through you.[A][ClearBox]But, why?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I am just a murderer.[Pause=3]
If a battle is over, then I need to search for
my next battlefield.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't you have any plans of settling down?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]My sword would grow dull.[A][ClearBox]If I stay in a place for too long, unnecessary
feelings develop within my heart.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]And why do you avoid that?[Pause=3]
It's completely normal for a human.
Life is more fun when full of emotion.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's how I live.

After listening to your story,[A][ClearBox]I feel ashamed for being so determined to
not lose to men.[A][ClearBox]After all, I see you can do the jobs of both
women and men.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Nah, it's nothing to brag about really.[A][ClearBox]Besides, I think your will to go beyond gender
distinctions is most admirable, Cecil.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You speak truly?
It makes me happy to hear that.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But, that aside, you'd better learn how to

edible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

front-lines alone.[A][ClearBox]So, if you[Pause=3] were to be surrounded by enemies
again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That.[A]
[FaceCommand=0x73]You needn't worry[Pause=1] in that case.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What,[Pause=3] why?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I only go to the front-lines[Pause=3] when you're with
me.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Zagaro and Wolf would be fine too,[Pause=3] but like
hell I'd[Pause=1] let those other guys[Pause=2] fit into our style.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] see.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah, that's right[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]That's why,[Pause=2] Roshe.[A][ClearBox]Will you[Pause=1] ride with me[Pause=3] through the battlefield?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes,[Pause=2] certainly.[A]

right?[A][ClearBox]If I were to be torn between all of them, why,
I could spend days choosing.[A][ClearBox]How do you choose your everyday dress?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Err[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Actually, Malliesia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]We don't have that kind of luxury in a small
island kingdom like Talis.[A][ClearBox]I don't have that many dresses myself.[A][ClearBox]And there's no way I'd only eat sweets.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You don't need to hide it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] I get it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're travelling incognito right now, so
you're hiding your identity, right?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm not quite hiding my identity, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's a true princess for you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

How did you know?[Pause=3]
I'm so embarrassed[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hey[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Malliesia.
I wonder if you're aware that Marth
happens to be engaged?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, Sir Jeigan told me.[A][ClearBox]But, since it's Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I'm sure he has deep reasons.[A][ClearBox]I shall keep on waiting for him, always[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Good luck.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thank you for your support, Princess[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
