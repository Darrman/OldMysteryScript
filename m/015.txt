MS015_OP1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SOLDIER_RED][LoadBackground=BBG40][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EIBEL][TargetRight]General, the missing Aritian remnants
have at long last been sighted![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Is that so? Heh heh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
How convenient.[Pause=3] We will have Gra's men
draw them in and be rid of them all at once.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Understood. But what of that knight?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You mean Abel?[A][ClearBox]Should it look as though he intends to
betray us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Kkkkccchhhh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Kill the hostage[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Besides, he's nothing but a deserter;
it's far too late for him to pledge
loyalty to his prince again.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Heh heh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] now that Abel is
their enemy, how will they fight[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

why would you come to my side[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I've given up my position and
have left Emperor Hardin's side.[A][ClearBox]There is no justice left in Akaneia.[Pause=3]
But justice lies in your Aritia.[Pause=3]
And that's why I've come to you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[Pause=3]
Then Tomth, will you fight with us?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed I shall.[Pause=3]
Let this battle be a testament to
my faith in you.[A][ClearBox][X]

But, for the sake of everyone, you
should start to make up with them...[A][ClearBox][X]

MS015_H1
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=OLDMAN][LoadBackground=BBG25]Apparently there are hordes of enemy
soldiers waitin' in the fortresses.[Pause=3]
This ain't the time to let your guard down![A][ClearBox][X]

MS015_H2
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=LADY][LoadBackground=BBG25]You[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]

We were worried sick![A][ClearBox][X]

MS015_H3
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=MAN2][LoadBackground=BBG25]Y'know, Gra's not too fond of Aritia.[A][ClearBox]But sometimes I just gotta wonder if
Akaneia's just forcin' Gra to fight us.[A][ClearBox][X]

MS015_H4
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=WOMAN2][LoadBackground=BBG25]After the castle fell,
Princess Ellis was stolen away

MS015_H6
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=MAN1][LoadBackground=BBG25]There are plenty o' enemy spies
lurkin' in this region.[A][ClearBox]Be careful[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
I think I just saw some movement
from one o' the fortresses.[A][ClearBox][X]

MS015_H7
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=MAN2][LoadBackground=BBG25]The mercenaries protecting the castle
are the cream of the crop; Astria's elites.[A][ClearBox]They're terrifying enemies for sure,
but I wonder if you could make an
ally out of them?[A][ClearBox][X]

MS015_BT_ABEL

MS015_ED1_PCF1
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG04][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][TargetRight]That was quite a battle.[Pause=3]
Is everyone alright?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]There's no need for concern, sire.[Pause=3]
Everybody has eagerly awaited this day.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yet, because of Akaneia's actions,
so many innocent lives have been lost.[A][ClearBox]How can I face them[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I've caused them great sorrow.
Because I was too weak[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Was I presumptuous in believing
I could protect my homeland?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, your highness, you're wrong![A}[ClearBox]You have a gentle heart, so that is
why no matter what hardships we face,
we can endure them.[A][ClearBox]We believe in you, so that
is why we follow you.[A][ClearBox]Your highness, please raise
your spirit!! We still haven't reclaimed
Aritia Castle.[A][ClearBox]There are probably many enemies
awaiting us, but this is our castle.
