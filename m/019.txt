[LoadBackground=BBG16][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BIRAKU]I knew it.
You intend to invade Coyote's palace.[A][ClearBox]The king forbade us from interfering[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But I will do anything to protect Coyote!
I'll defy his edict if I have to[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=ROSHE][LoadBackground=][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BIRAKU][TargetRight]Biraku[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] Why are you here?[Pause=3]
The king told us not to interfere.[A][ClearBox]Aha! Have you decided to join the
Aritian army like me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Roshe, I came to bring you back.[A][ClearBox]Why have you turned to the Aritians?[Pause=3]
We are Coyote's subordinates.[A][ClearBox]Open your eyes!
You're being deceived![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You're wrong, Biraku.[A][ClearBox]The time I spent with the Aritians was
short, but I know one thing for sure.[A][ClearBox]It's not as Coyote says.
They're not evil people.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Roshe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Biraku, please.[Pause=3]

which were the good guys,
and which were the bad.[A][ClearBox]I can't fight you, Roshe.[Pause=3]

It's me, Biraku.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What's the meaning of this, Biraku?
Don't tell me you've defected!?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Listen, Zagaro.[Pause=3]
I[SpecialSymbol=0x96]I don't know.[Pause=3]
What am I supposed to do?[A][ClearBox]I loved Coyote like a brother.[Pause=3]
All I wanted was to fight for him.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But he has changed for the worse.[Pause=3]
It's as though he's someone else now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]I wanted to serve him, always.[Pause=3]
That's why I've been turning a blind eye.[A][ClearBox]I shut myself, trying to remember
the Coyote who loved us so long ago.[A][ClearBox]It really hurt to face the truth.[Pause=3]
That Coyote's not who he used to be[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I just don't know anymore.[Pause=3]
Hey, Zagaro[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
What the hell am I supposed to do?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Biraku[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]I too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I feel the same way.[Pause=3]
I know he's gone insane, but I looked
the other way and blocked my senses.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]One day,
he'll go back to being our Coyote[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's what I kept telling myself.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Roshe has gone over to the Aritians.[Pause=3]
I cannot fight him.[A][ClearBox]Zagaro, you should come too.[Pause=3]
I don't know what's right anymore.[Pause=3]
But I don't want to fight you, either.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Even though Coyote's madness
was clear to me, I did nothing.[Pause=3]
I have to make this right.[A][ClearBox][X]

This is for Coyote's own good[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Something's wrong with Coyote.
Even you must know that[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That changes nothing[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
I will die at Coyote's side[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
I swore as much[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Though all of you might betray us.
Though I might be alone.
I will not abandon him[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Even though you disobey his heart?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What do you mean[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wolf, do you remember what Coyote said

righteous, please[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] lead me back onto it."
That's what he said.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I should never have forgotten.[Pause=3]
The words of Coyote himself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]But, to tell me that time has come[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That we must[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That we must defeat Coyote[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]We have to remind Coyote of the day
we swore allegiance to him.[A][ClearBox]No matter how painful it may be[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That is our only recourse.[A][ClearBox]I never wanted to believe it
would come to this[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Enough, Zagaro[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]For goodness sake[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

You're hurt[FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth]
What on earth happened?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ngh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] this is terrible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
House Akaneia must truly be cursed.[A][ClearBox]As you know, two years ago[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Hardin and Princess Nina were wed.[A][ClearBox]In order to restore Akaneia to glory,
a king was needed.[A][ClearBox]There were but two suitable individuals:[Pause=3]
King Orleans's younger brother, Duke Hardin,
and you, Prince Marth of Aritia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Princess Nina begged me to wait
just a while longer, but once
I insisted of its absolute urgency[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]She said that it could not be you,
for Princess Sheeda would grieve.
In the end, Hardin was our only choice[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Let me get this straight.[Pause=3]
I understand that Akaneia
could not be without a king.[A][ClearBox]But Princess Nina, she already[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You speak of Sir Camus of Grunia?[Pause=3]
The people must never know[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
'Twould be heresy.[A][ClearBox]The decision cost us dearly,
but what choice did we have?
It was for our country.[A][ClearBox]On the bright side, Hardin was happy.[A][ClearBox]In fact, the thought that he was to
be Princess Nina's husband pleased him
greater than his ascension to the throne.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I know of his feelings.[A][ClearBox]I know that he would have given
his life for Princess Nina.[A][ClearBox]But, did he know about Camus?
If he did, I don't believe
he would be so happy.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MS019_ED1_2
[TargetLeft]Mmm... Of course we kept that a secret,
and we also persuaded Nina to hide it
as best as she could.[A}[ClearBox]But, Lord Hardin was a very sensitive man.[A][ClearBox]He soon realized that
Princess Nina did not reciprocate his love.[A][ClearBox]It pained him greatly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
He shut himself into his room, drinking
away his sorrows, and saw no one.[A][ClearBox]Spotting an opportune moment,
as Hardin wallowed in heartbreak,
Garnef appeared.[A][ClearBox]He took on the guise of a merchant
to approach Hardin, and showed
him the Dark Orb.[A][ClearBox]The despairing emperor's heart was
gripped by the Dark Orb in an instant.[A][ClearBox]He completely changed as a
person from then.[A][ClearBox]I've made a terrible mistake,
out of my concern for this kingdom.
[EyeCommand=ec]Please forgive me, Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's how it is.[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And what of Princess Nina?
How is she now?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]When Hardin discovered that she had
taken the Emblem Shield, he had her
confined in her room.[A][ClearBox]After that, she would still communicate
in secret with me.[A][ClearBox]However, Hardin found out and wounded me.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]He then handed Princess Nina to Garnef.[A][ClearBox]Garnef said that he required the blood
of noble-born clerics in order to resurrect
the Dark Dragon[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And so...
He took Nina...
To use her as a live sacrifice...[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth, my end is nigh.[Pause=3]
I shall give you my tome and staff.[A][ClearBox]Please save Princess Nina.[A][ClearBox]Even if Akaneia's destruction
cannot be undone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Make sure that she is safe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]
