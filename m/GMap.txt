Once, there was a war known as the
"War of Darkness."[A][ClearBox]An epic battle between Prince Marth's heroes
and the Durhuan Empire,[A][ClearBox]which ended with the defeat of the Earth 
Dragon King, Mediuth.[A][ClearBox][UnfreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth]The warriors who had united under the
Fire Emblem returned to their own lands,[A][ClearBox]devoting themselves to the reconstruction of
their homelands.[A][ClearBox][UnfreezeMouth]Among the nations that made up the
"Seven Kingdoms of Akaneia",[A][ClearBox]Gra and Grunia were devastated.[A][ClearBox]Aritia, Orleans, Macedonia and Talis were left
deeply scarred,[A][ClearBox]and even the mighty Kingdom of Akaneia was
undergoing restoration.[A][ClearBox][UnfreezeMouth]However, in Pales still shaken by war,
one important event took place.[A][ClearBox]Hardin, the younger brother of King Orleans,
was married to Princess Nina,[A][ClearBox]becoming the twenty-fourth king of House
Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]After ascending the throne,[A][ClearBox]Hardin aggressively restored the country
in the twinkling of an eye,[A][ClearBox]and formed a powerful army by gathering
many soldiers.[A][ClearBox]He then proclaimed the restoration of the
Holy Akaneian Empire, and himself Emperor.[A][ClearBox][UnfreezeMouth]One year has passed since the war with Durhua.[A][ClearBox]The world seemed to be moving towards an
era of peace.[A][ClearBox][UnfreezeMouth]However, unbeknownst to man, the cogs of
destiny had started spiralling out of order.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_001
It has been a year since the War of Darkness
ended. The war-ravaged kingdom of Aritia[A][ClearBox]was finally starting to regain stability thanks
to Prince Marth's efforts.[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth's engagement to Princess Sheeda
was announced,[A][ClearBox]and the people of Aritia rejoiced, sharing their
happiness.[A][ClearBox]However...
Nearing the day of their wedding,[A][ClearBox]an unexpected letter arrived from the
imperial palace, containing an imperial edict.[A][ClearBox]"Dear Prince Marth of Aritia,[A][ClearBox]"In the kingdom of Grunia, now under imperial
  rule, a large-scale rebellion has broken out.[A][ClearBox]"I request your kingdom's assistance in its
  subjugation.[A][ClearBox]"Your Highness is to lead the entire army of
  Aritia and sortie at once,[A][ClearBox]"supressing the Grunian rebellion.
  [SpecialSymbol=0x96]The Emperor of Akaneia"[A][ClearBox]The Kingdom of Akaneia was Aritia's
suzerain, so its orders were absolute.[A][ClearBox]Forced to comply, Marth ordered the knight
Kain to protect his homeland,[A][ClearBox]and together with Jeigan, the paladin Alan,
and the young, newly appointed knights[A][ClearBox]left Aritia on the Grunian expedition.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_002
Leaving painful memories behind, Marth and
his companions left Grunia.[A][ClearBox]They landed in Macedonia; their new mission to
rescue Princess Minerva.[A][ClearBox]After the War of Darkness, Macedonia was led
by Minerva,[A][ClearBox]who exiled the oppressive generals and
attempted to reform the military.[A][ClearBox]However, the influential General Ryuke
opposed Minerva's peace-seeking ways.[A][ClearBox]He assembled the exiled officers to instigate
a coup d'etat.[A][ClearBox]Caught unprepared, Minerva was captured
by Ryuke's followers,[A][ClearBox]and his rebel army seized control of Macedonia.[A][ClearBox]Then, they dispached powerful dragon knights
to guard the country's forested borders.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_003
Once upon a time, the region of Macedonia
was a territory under Durhuan rule.[A][ClearBox]A century ago, the dragonkin rulers sent
many slaves to these wild forests,[A][ClearBox]to excavate ruins and build a country.[A][ClearBox]Many slaves were forced to work to their
limits, barely fed, and then slaughtered.[A][ClearBox]A young man stood up against such tragic
conditions. Iote was his name.[A][ClearBox]He and his companions fled to the forests and
fought, astride wyverns, to free the slaves.[A][ClearBox]After Durhua's demise, the slaves established
their own country in these now abundant lands.[A][ClearBox]And the hero Iote was chosen as their first
king.[A][ClearBox]And so was born the Kingdom of Macedonia,
later feared as the domain of dragon knights.[A][ClearBox]However, the mighty Macedonia[A][ClearBox]was stripped of Prince Misheil, said to be
the second coming of Iote,[A][ClearBox]and is now on the brink of losing Princess
Minerva, the so-called "Crimson Dragoon."[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_004
Marth was unable to reunite with Princess
Minerva, and so,[A][ClearBox]in order to help Oguma and the Grunian royal
children,[A][ClearBox]he decided to visit Wendel, who was once the
childrens' guardian.[A][ClearBox]However, the "Holm Beach" where Wendel
resides[A][ClearBox]is dominion of the infamous Macedonian Vikings.[A][ClearBox]Countless pirates await in Marth's path.[A][ClearBox]Will Marth be able to safely rescue the
children...?[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_005
The shocking news brought by Sheeda was a
terrible blow to Marth.[A][ClearBox]Hardin was once not only a comrade-in-arms,[A][ClearBox]but a trusted confidant and irreplaceable
friend.[A][ClearBox]"Yet... why attack Aritia?
What have I done wrong?"[A][ClearBox]Filled with frustration, Marth hurried his
return to his homeland,[A][ClearBox]but the first barrier stood in his way:[A][ClearBox]Olbern Keep, headquarters of the Grunian
Occupation Army led by the evil General Lang...[A][ClearBox]also known as the "Nest of Vice."[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_006
Grunia has been liberated.[A][ClearBox]All that remains is Olbern Keep, where
General Lang remains barricaded.[A][ClearBox]Lang used his influence to steal belongings,
daughters and lives from the people of Grunia.[A][ClearBox]Was there ever a man as cruel as he is?[A][ClearBox]"I cannot forgive him.
I shall take him down without fail!"[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth raised his sword to the skies
and ordered firmly:[A][ClearBox]"Aritian knights, charge!!"[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_007
Having liberated Grunia, Marth and his
companions accepted Wendel's request[A][ClearBox]and stopped by the Raman Temple in search
of the missing orbs.[A][ClearBox]However, the ancient temple built to worship
Narga had been wrecked by constant warring,[A][ClearBox]and was now nothing more than a den of
thieves.[A][ClearBox]"They're escaping with the temple's valuable
treasures. We must catch them!"[A][ClearBox]"Stay clear of the free company guarding
Cashmere Bridge. We cannot defeat them."[A][ClearBox]"It seems a dancer is lost inside the forest.
We must find her before the bandits do!"[A][ClearBox]As the soldiers received their orders,[A][ClearBox]the flames of a new battle around the
Raman Temple were ignited.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_008
Soon after reclaiming the Raman Temple,[A][ClearBox]Marth's army fears pursuit from the Akaneian
army and escapes towards Cashmere Bridge.[A][ClearBox]However, a new enemy attacks the Aritian
army upon reaching the central islet.[A][ClearBox]"The Akaneian army is coming from the
north; we'll be surrounded like this."[A][ClearBox]The situation is desperate! Can Marth and
his friends overcome the many perils?[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_009
Marth barely succeeded in escaping,
disembarking in the desert of Khadein.[A][ClearBox]He elected to await his subordinates' safe
arrival.[A][ClearBox]Khadein, the city of magic, is a sanctuary
for mages.[A][ClearBox]Many prospecting mages come here and
undergo rigorous training.[A][ClearBox]Magic relies on containing nature's energies
in "tomes" and "staves",[A][ClearBox]freely manipulating these energies to harness
great power.[A][ClearBox]A few centuries ago, a lone sage founded
an academy here, teaching magic's secrets.[A][ClearBox]However, instead of bringing happiness,
magic was soon used as a tool of war[A][ClearBox]and a thing to be traded.[A][ClearBox]The sage was disappointed, and vanished
from the pages of history.[A][ClearBox]Though there is no confirmation, some say
that was the Archsage Gato.[A][ClearBox]Currently, advanced magic like Aura cannot
be made without the orbs' power,[A][ClearBox]and their use is restricted to a few chosen
ones.[A][ClearBox]Those conditions are set by their creator,[A][ClearBox]and they can only be inherited by those who
qualify.[A][ClearBox]Khadein, the city of magic... the proud
Sanctuary of Sorcery.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_010
Khadein is an independent city-state,
taking orders from no foreign nation.[A][ClearBox]The Archmage has many pontifices under him,
governing according to their counsel.[A][ClearBox]In the previous war, Archbishop Garnef allied
with Durhua and dragged Khadein into war,[A][ClearBox]and the city suffered great damage as result.[A][ClearBox]As Khadein had lost all of its pontifices,[A][ClearBox]Wendel became its Archmage and started
rebuilding the city.[A][ClearBox]However, Wendel left on a journey to fulfill
a mission given to him by Gato.[A][ClearBox]He then left Khadein in the care of two
young men.[A][ClearBox]They were two skilled and promising young
mages... Marich and Ellerean.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_011
Seeking the Light Orb, Marth and his
friends headed for the Tower of Thabes.[A][ClearBox]Thabes is an ancient city buried under the
sands, along with many treasures.[A][ClearBox]The legend of Thabes, city of illusion, lured
many adventurous men to the desert.[A][ClearBox]However, in the end... not one of them ever
returned.[A][ClearBox]As the sages once said... stay clear of
Marmotord, the desert of death.[A][ClearBox]There lies the cursed Dark City.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_012
Marth and his friends follow Chainy,
marching towards the northern lands.[A][ClearBox]Before their eyes are walls of towering
mountains, sheer cliffs and deep valleys...[A][ClearBox]After passing countless mountains, they are
assaulted by scorching heat.[A][ClearBox]Magma flowing like a river and rumbling like
thunder blocks their way.[A][ClearBox]Truly a dreadful scene, as if straight out of
a nightmare.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_013
This was truly a journey beyond all imagination.[A][ClearBox]Five thousand meters...
No, perhaps even higher than that.[A][ClearBox]The clouds already below them, they ascend
the frozen mountain.[A][ClearBox]Suffocation...
Vertigo...[A][ClearBox]They were already approaching the limits of
their strengths.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_014
The unexpected truth revealed by Chainy took
Marth by surprise.[A][ClearBox]Chiki was the daughter of the Divine Dragon
King, Narga,[A][ClearBox]and was sleeping in the temple because the
king so willed.[A][ClearBox]The Divine Dragon King's fear of Chiki's
power was that of a loving parent.[A][ClearBox]Were Chiki to awaken, her dreadful hidden
power would eventually destroy the world...[A][ClearBox]So thought the king.[A][ClearBox]However, Banutu, the king's servant,[A][ClearBox]changed his mind after centuries of watching
Chiki,[A][ClearBox]waking her from her slumber and whisking her
away.[A][ClearBox]That's why Chiki's memories are just the ten
years she lived as a human...[A][ClearBox]"Poor Chiki..."[A][ClearBox]Marth was too bewildered to think.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_015
Transported to Aritia's outskirts by Gato's
mighty Warp magic, Marth and his army[A][ClearBox]finally began the battle to liberate their
homeland.[A][ClearBox]However, General Eibel, commander of the
Akaneian army,[A][ClearBox]ordered the Gra knights to attack, in order
to buy time.[A][ClearBox]In the meantime, he prepared his own devious
tactics[A][ClearBox]with the aim of crushing the Aritian army in
one fell swoop.[A][ClearBox]With their dear homeland before them, Marth
and the others start yet another battle.[A][ClearBox]"Recapture Anri, our capital!
We shall now reclaim our homeland!"[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth's voice resounded through the
serene skies of Aritia.[A][ClearBox]One of the objectives of their long and
difficult journey was already within reach.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_016
It was a fierce battle like no other.[A][ClearBox]However, Aritia has been liberated.
Yes, our homeland has been liberated.[A][ClearBox]"Only the castle remains... If we regain
Aritia Castle, where I was born and raised..."[A][ClearBox]"Thank you, my friends...
Thank you for believing in me..."[A][ClearBox]Tears shimmered down Marth's face.[A][ClearBox]And the girl who gently wiped away his tears
couldn't stop her own...[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_017
Marth once again departed from Aritia,
heading towards the capital of Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]However, the Kingdom of Gra, ally to
Akaneia, stood in their path.[A][ClearBox]Gra allied with Durhua in the previous war; King
Jiol fell in battle, and the kingdom was lost.[A][ClearBox]Gra was annexed to Aritia at one point,[A][ClearBox]but, by Emperor Hardin's order, it was
returned to Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]Hardin found King Jiol's daughter, Princess
Sheema, and allowed her to take the throne,[A][ClearBox]providing support to Gra.[A][ClearBox]Sheema received fanatical support from her
people.[A][ClearBox]To them, Sheema was their only hope.[A][ClearBox]The youths volunteered to become soldiers
one after the other.[A][ClearBox]And then, happily moved out to exact
revenge on Aritia, their bitter enemy.[A][ClearBox]However, their dreams were shattered...[A][ClearBox]Before the fast approaching Aritian elites,
the Gra soldiers lost the will to fight[A][ClearBox]and started fleeing for their lives.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_018
Aiming to avoid needless battles, the Aritian
army[A][ClearBox]decided to cross the central mountain range,
thought to be impassable by a large army.[A][ClearBox]Should they go through the Adria Pass,
they would reach Pales directly.[A][ClearBox]"Hurry, we cannot let the enemy notice us!
We must charge straight through!"[A][ClearBox]Praying for success, Marth and the others
walked through the narrow mountain pass.[A][ClearBox]However, despite their prayers,[A][ClearBox]they were attacked by an unexpected enemy
in the pass.[A][ClearBox]The northern Kingdom of Orleans's elite force,
which had moved south to aid Akaneia...[A][ClearBox]The "Wolfguard."[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_019
Imperial calendar, the year 3, February....[A][ClearBox]The holy palace of Akaneia was enveloped
by a strange silence.[A][ClearBox]Following a rebellion in Akaneia,[A][ClearBox]many capable knights, starting with the
Paladin Midia, were captured.[A][ClearBox]However, even then Akaneia had double
Aritia's manpower,[A][ClearBox]Pales's streets teeming with soldiers.[A][ClearBox]Nearly one year has passed since the
Grunian expedition...[A][ClearBox]And now, the decisive battle that would settle
the fate of two nations was about to begin.[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_020
Saint Akaneia: the largest kingdom in the
continent.[A][ClearBox]Pales: a golden capital proud of its six
hundred years of history.[A][ClearBox]However, under the attack of Aritia's allied
forces, it fell in a mere day.[A][ClearBox]The Akaneians welcomed them as liberators,
supporting them without sparing efforts.[A][ClearBox]All of them had bitter words about Hardin and
his bodyguards, who were inside the castle.[A][ClearBox]The people now called Hardin the Dark Emperor.[A][ClearBox]A title symbolic of the people's hatred for he
who had killed so many.[A][ClearBox]"I didn't wish to fight, given the choice,
but now that it's come to this..."[A][ClearBox]Marth raises Anri's flag up high, issuing his
final order.[A][ClearBox]"Go, heroes of Aritia!
This is the final battle.[A][ClearBox]All forces, charge into Pales!!"[A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_021
Guided by Archsage Gato,[A][ClearBox]Marth and his companions moved to the
"Dragon's Dale", located north of Macedonia.[A][ClearBox]The dale is a savage land populated by
wyverns and ruled by barbarians.[A][ClearBox]However, Marth had no time to waste.[A][ClearBox]The world's fate was in his hands![A][ClearBox][X]

MSGMP_022
In front of the towering craggy mountain,
a stone bridge.[A][ClearBox]Then, a stone, spiralling stairway[A][ClearBox]that seemed to stretch up towards the
heavens.[A][ClearBox]From the rough bare rocks, ominous roars
and deep breathing can be heard,[A][ClearBox]as if the very mountain itself were alive.[A][ClearBox]The Dragon's Altar... An ancient relic of the
old dragonkin.[A][ClearBox]The place where Narga, the Divine Dragon
King, sealed the earth dragons.[A][ClearBox]And now, six hundred years later, the earth
dragons were awakening.[A][ClearBox]Countless evil demons were being born...[A][ClearBox][X]
