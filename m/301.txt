I will not accept the possibility of[Pause=3]
surrendering to the likes of them[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Midia, don't be selfish.[Pause=3]
Do you intend to involve Princess Nina
in this battle?[A][ClearBox]The princess is the last hope[Pause=3] of the people of
Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]What would you tell them,[Pause=3] should anything
befall her?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I[FreezeMouth]... [UnfreezeMouth]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Forgive my rashness.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=NIENA]Bishop.[Pause=3]
I agree with Midia.[A][ClearBox]No matter what grim fate awaits us,[Pause=3] I want
us to hold our heads[Pause=3] high with pride until the

me,[A][ClearBox]then I want to entrust them[Pause=3] with my final
desire.[A][ClearBox]Bishop, please allow my wish to become true.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Princess[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

You are still searching for Astria, correct?[A][ClearBox]So, don't worry about me.
Escape by yourself![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]There is no worse disgrace than to[Pause=3] abandon

They are but few in number,[Pause=3] yet, some

However, I see Akaneia's paladins are fond
of dishonorable tactics.[Pause=3] To think they would
ambush an unarmed foe.[A][ClearBox]Not only is the Akaneian army thoroughly

are all Akaneians this irresponsible?[A][ClearBox]In Grunia,[Pause=3] this kind of behavior is reserved

Y-you drove my father to his death[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Forgive me for what I am about to say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
But your father[Pause=3] was a failure of a king.[A][ClearBox]He drowned in pleasure, neglected politics,[Pause=3]
and ultimately abandoned his people.[Pause=3]
Akaneia's miserable defeat was his doing.[A][ClearBox]The one who led your people to the abyss of
despair[Pause=3] was none other than King Akaneia
himself.[A][ClearBox]It is the king's duty to protect his people.[A][ClearBox]King Akaneia [Pause=3]may have been a good father
