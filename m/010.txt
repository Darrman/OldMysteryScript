[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICH][LoadBackground=BBG11][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN][TargetLeft]Marich[FreezeMouth].[UnfreezeMouth]
It's time to put an end to this.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wait, Ellerean[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why do we have to fight?[A][ClearBox]We were both Master Wendel's pupils:
we're friends, are we not?
Why do you despise me so?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I was Master Wendel's disciple before you,
and I was the stronger one.[A][ClearBox]Even so, Master Wendel gave you Excalibur.
He should have given it to me![A][ClearBox]Why, Marich?
Is it because you're a noble of Aritia?[A][ClearBox]Clearly, I was the only one worthy to be his
successor, yet he[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is that it? I'm sorry, Ellerean.
But I have no intention of succeeding
Master Wendel.[A][ClearBox]I hold no ill feelings for Khadein, but once I
finish studying I plan to go home.[A][ClearBox]Back in Aritia, there is somebody I must
protect for the rest of my life[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]That's why Master Wendel's successor
can only be you.[A][ClearBox]So, Ellerean, please[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why don't you join us so we can take back
Aritia?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Aritia, you say[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Why should we help a country that rebelled
against the empire and was invaded by them?[A][ClearBox]Why should I help them?
The mage corps of Khadein have sworn
allegiance to Emperor Hardin.[A][ClearBox]Oh, I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I knew it was you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
YOU dragged the Aritian army here[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's not how it is[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Shut your mouth, traitor[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I won't listen to your lies any longer[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Your Excalibur and my Thoron;
we'll put them to the test[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MS010_EV1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG11][TargetRight]Everyone, we must rescue Marich[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
However, the enemies include clerics who cannot fight.[A][ClearBox]It would seem that they are being
threatened by the enemy. 
Please, try not to hurt them.[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=WENDEL][LoadBackground=][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN][TargetRight]Ellerean[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What are you doing[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Master Wendel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
You've returned...[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You still don't understand my decision,
do you?[A][ClearBox]Indeed, as a mage, your power surpasses
mine.[A][ClearBox]But you lack compassion.[Pause=3]
That is why I did not grant you Excalibur.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Compassion[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I had decided that you were to be my
successor when the time came.[A][ClearBox]To think you would harbor a grudge towards
me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Does that not make you the same as
Garnef?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The same as Garnef[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Teacher[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] What are you saying?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ellerean, listen to me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Garnef, along with Archbishop Miroa, were
Lord Gato's best pupils.[A][ClearBox]But Lord Gato saw Garnef's weakness,
and so he left Khadein and the Aura tome
to Archbishop Miroa.[A][ClearBox]Garnef, overcome by jealousy, stole the
Dark Orb from Lord Gato, and created
the Maph tome.[A][ClearBox]As a result[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
His heart was trapped within the Dark Orb
for all eternity.[A][ClearBox]Originally Garnef was a youth with a 
strong sense of justice.
Wrath and envy led him to ruin.[A][ClearBox][Pause=3]Do you understand now, Ellerean[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Teacher[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That is all that I can say to you.
I hope you will understand.
You still have many things to learn,[A][ClearBox]and your will is too weak.
Do you really intend on retreading
Garnef's path?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Teacher[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm so sorry. 
I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I was wrong.[A][ClearBox]Please[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] find it in your heart to forgive me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ellerean,[Pause=3] you will use that power of yours for
the good of the people. 
Understand[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[LoadBackground=][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN]I won't lose to someone like Marich.
Anyone who sides with him is my enemy.[Pause=3]

Do you hear me[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Yes, I can[FreezeMouth].[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] You are speaking to me through
magic, are you not?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes... You summoned me?
I will share with you my strength.
What is it that you wish for?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Lord Gato, I must ask:[Pause=3] what has happened
to cause Hardin to suddenly change so
much? And what power is protecting him?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] The Dark Orb is the culprit[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
The Dark Orb is what's shielding Hardin[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The Dark Orb?[Pause=3]
What on earth is that?[A][ClearBox]
[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MS010_ED1_2
[TargetLeft]Hmmm... I have no choice but to tell you.
Light, Star, Earth, Life and Darkness[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
In this world, there exist five sacred orbs.[A][ClearBox]Aside from the Light, Star and Earth Orbs,
there is also the Life Orb
and what is known as the Dark Orb.[A][ClearBox]The Dark Orb opposes the Light Orb,
and it can greatly increase the
strength of one's mind.[A][ClearBox]It can give its owner courage,
release them from suffering, and increase
their ambitions and wishes.[A][ClearBox]In battle, it possesses the enemy's mind,
negating their attacks.[A][ClearBox]But, the Dark Orb is too dangerous for
humans to use. It also amplifies wrath and
envy, causing them to increase tenfold.[A][ClearBox]Eventually it will destroy their soul
and turn them into a demon.[A][ClearBox]Hardin must have obtained the Dark Orb
from somewhere[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
And now his heart has been lost to it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But why[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Hardin isn't such a weak man.
He should have been happy after
his union with his beloved Princess Nina,[A]
so why the envy[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Prince[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Humans are never simple creatures[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But regardless, as long as Hardin has
the Dark Orb you cannot win.[A][ClearBox]The only object that can overcome Hardin's
Dark Orb is the Light Orb.[A][ClearBox]If you want to do something about him,
then you had best come and get it from me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh? Really, Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If we have the Light Orb then we can
save Hardin[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] If his heart is not completely consumed,
then perhaps. But that depends on whether
Hardin is as strong-willed as you say...[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Please, lend the Light Orb to me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]If you come in person to the Ice Dragons'
Temple where I reside, then you shall have it.[A][ClearBox]But that will be no easy task.[A][ClearBox]There has only been one human that
has ever made it here.
That's right... The hero Anri.[A][ClearBox]If you, like Anri, are a true hero,
I will lend you the Orb.[A][ClearBox]So, Marth.[Pause=3]
Do you have the courage to walk the path
that Anri walked?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I do[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] I will go[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Please, allow me to go[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I must have the Light Orb[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]
[TargetLeft]Then, first head directly north,
across the Marmotord Desert,
and then come to Thebes Tower.[A][ClearBox]I will have somebody meet you there.[A][ClearBox]
[TargetRight]Okay, I understand.
I'll be there for sure!![A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]

I came here 'cause I heard Marth's group

A mercenary, and not a cheap one.[A][ClearBox]I'd like to ask you something:
is yer prince okay with paying gold?[A][ClearBox]Oh, of course, it's okay if I have to wait
until this war's over.[Pause=3]
So, erm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]If you, er, paid us, say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] 590 gold for our
services, that ought to do, I think.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh? If it's only that much, then
Prince Marth would gladly pay[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Phew[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] The rumors are true.[Pause=3]
He's completely different from all our
employers up till now. Right, Pops?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=DICE][FaceCommand=0x73]He IS different.[Pause=3]
