[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]I have no love for General Lang and his
extremely rude attitude, but we have a
task we must complete.[A][ClearBox]I am sure you have things on your mind,
but you must hold them in for now.[A][ClearBox]Our foremost objective is quell the rebellion
in Macedonia and rescue Princess Minerva.[A][ClearBox]It pains me, but we had no choice but to
leave the young prince and princess behind
in Grunia.[A][ClearBox]However, should we successfully rescue
Princess Minerva, Prince Marth could be
in a position to obtain custody of them.[A][ClearBox]Before that, we have to crush the
dragon knights in Macedonia's rebel army and
cross the forest.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_003_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]We made it through the bordering forest.
At last, it is time to quell the Macedonian
rebellion and rescue Princess Minerva.[A][ClearBox]But that aside, I do wonder why Princess
Nina entrusted Prince Marth with the Fire
Emblem[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]The emblem is to be given to one who fights
in the name of justice; in the name of
House Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]Hardin should have delivered peace to
Akaneia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Appointing Lang as commander and now this
drama? Just what has happened to Hardin?[A][ClearBox]Oh well.
Prince Marth said he'd go see the princess
once this battle is over.[A][ClearBox]Everything will become clear once the time
comes.[Pause=3] But now, we must focus on quelling
the rebellion in Macedonia.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_103_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Apparently, the assassins who made an
attempt on Prince Marth's life have
appeared in the northern mountains.[A][ClearBox]There are rumors that they are targetting
former comrades of ours, from the War of
Shadows.[A][ClearBox]The prince has decided to pursue the enemy.
Let us hurry the battle preparations.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_004_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]We have quelled the rebellion in Macedonia.[Pause=3]
However, Princess Minerva, thought to be
in the rebels' grasp, is elsewhere[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]If only we had met the princess, we might
have been able to avoid confronting Lang
like that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I myself have no regrets.
The question is how he's going to react.[Pause=3]
I just hope he won't do anything bad[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]According to Lang, Sir Oguma took the prince
and princess of Grunia and is going to meet
Lord Wendel.[A][ClearBox]We, too, came here to join Sir Oguma, but
this is pirate territory. We must proceed
carefully.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_005_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]My greatest fear has been realized[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Emperor Hardin of Akaneia planned to
invade our kingdom from the very start.[A][ClearBox]If we consider the speed of this invasion,
the Grunian expedition and the rebellion
in Macedonia were no doubt traps.[A][ClearBox]Make no mistake of it:
The Akaneian army is now our enemy.[A][ClearBox]We will be returning to Aritia.
After going through the stronghold of Lang's
occupation army, that is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]We cannot let Lang be, especially after he
ensnared our kingdom and tormented the
people of Grunia.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_006_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Grunia has been liberated.
All that's left now is to seize Olbern Keep.[A][ClearBox]Therein lies Lang, oppressor of the people,
the one who led General Lawrence to death,
and kidnapper of the Grunian children[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]It's time for us to punish him for his sins.
And then we shall return to Aritia, and
reclaim our homeland from Akaneia.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_106_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Apparently, a mercenary group is awaiting
us at our destination.[A][ClearBox]However, we are the renowned and mighty
Aritian army. There is no need for us to
fear mere mercenaries.[A][ClearBox]We'll crush the enemy and return to Aritia
as soon as possible.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_007_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]By our hands, Grunia has been liberated,
and we are en route to our homeland[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
But first, we stop by the Raman Temple.[A][ClearBox]I believe you've already heard, but this was
a request by Lord Wendel, who was held
captive by the Akaneian army.[A][ClearBox]It's said that if even one of the five orbs
were to be lost the world would fall into ruin,[A][ClearBox]and now the Star Orb has shattered into
twelve pieces[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Prince Marth is going to help gather them.[A][ClearBox]I just wish the Raman Temple has what we
desire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_008_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Never mind the orbs; the Raman Temple
was devoid of anything.[A][ClearBox]And now, even though our homeland Aritia
stands before our eyes, the Akaneian
army pursues us from both directions.[A][ClearBox]It is a difficult situation, but we must escape
this crisis somehow.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_009_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]After hearing that our homeland Aritia had
been crushed by Akaneia, we rushed to its
aid.[A][ClearBox]However, we were stopped in our tracks by
Emperor Hardin of Akaneia and now we
must run away from Aritia's direction.[A][ClearBox]This is just too much for these old bones to
bear[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Hardin is protected by an arcane power[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
We won't be able to save our homeland
if we don't do something about him.[A][ClearBox]Right now, we have no choice but to take
refuge in Khadein and search for a method
to defeat Hardin.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_010_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Who would have thought that even Khadein
would be our enemy?[A][ClearBox]I'm sure this revelation caused Prince Marth
no small pain[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]What has the world come to?
Not only does Hardin attack us, but even
Khadein, our safest allies in this era.[A][ClearBox]Sir Marich, a close friend of the prince,
is here in Khadein's sanctuary.[A][ClearBox]I am sure the truth will become clear once
we're inside the building.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_110_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]According to reports, Sir Horace, a knight
who was once our comrade, is in peril.[A][ClearBox]Sir Horace is an Akaneian knight, but he
has sworn loyalty to Princess Nina, not to
Emperor Hardin.[A][ClearBox]He said he wishes to join us again.
We must rescue him without fail.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_011_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]We have said our goodbyes to Khadein,
and are now about to challenge Anri's Way.[A][ClearBox]Do you remember what Lord Gato said?[A][ClearBox]We have to save Hardin, now a slave to the
Dark Orb, if we hope to bring salvation to
our homeland.[A][ClearBox]If we reach the Ice Dragons' Temple beyond
Anri's Way, we'll obtain the Light Orb,[A][ClearBox]and then we'll be able to neutralize Hardin's
Dark Orb[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But to do that, we first have to cross the
Desert of Death.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_012_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Anri's Way is long and hard,[Pause=3] but we must
reach the Ice Dragons' Temple in order to
obtain the Light Orb.[A][ClearBox]The Light Orb is an absolute necessity
if we wish to negate Hardin's Dark Orb[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]If we obtain it, the day of Aritia's liberation
comes ever closer as well.[A][ClearBox]Chainy, whom you've just met, seems to be
oddly knowledgeable about Anri's Way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
A welcome companion on this harsh path.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_013_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]We've passed the Desert of Death and the
Fire Dragons' Graveyard.[Pause=3] The last of
Anri's Way leads to the Ice Dragons' Temple.[A][ClearBox]If we obtain the Light Orb from Lord
Gato, we'll be able to combat the
Dark Orb that controls Hardin.[A][ClearBox]And then, we might just be able to reclaim
Aritia and save Hardin.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_113_OUTLINE

assassins[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]As Prince Marth said, if our allies are
fighting, we cannot leave them to their
fates.[A][ClearBox]The battlefield is a blizzard.[Pause=3]

MBTK_014_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Seeking the Light Orb, we passed the
harsh Anri's Way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] and now, finally, we
stand before the Ice Dragons' Temple.[A][ClearBox]Lord Gato should be waiting for Prince
Marth here.[A][ClearBox]But, the revelation about the Shield of Seals,
which, with its five orbs, seals the earth
dragons in its bind,[A][ClearBox]and that the seal would fragment should any
of the orbs break[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I wonder if that's what Lord Wendel meant 
when he said the world would fall into ruin
if any of the orbs were lost?[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_015_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]It was a arduous journey like no other,
but we can wave farewell to Anri's Way.[A][ClearBox]At the Ice Dragons' Temple, Prince Marth
obtained the Light Orb from Lord Gato.[A][ClearBox]With it, we can now challenge Hardin and his
Dark Orb.[Pause=3] And now is the time for us to

Akaneia, but couldn't return right away[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Without a way to defeat Emperor Hardin,
we had no choice but to flee to Khadein[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Seeking the Light Orb, we travelled
through Anri's Way to obtain it from
Lord Gato in the Ice Dragons' Temple[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And then, finally, we returned to Aritia.[A][ClearBox]The time to fulfill our oath draws near.
All that's left is to recapture Aritia Castle.[A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Another attack from those assassins[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
We've finally reclaimed our homeland,
yet we don't get even a moment of rest.[A][ClearBox]But, being attacked by assassins in Aritia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
It reminds me of your knighthood ceremony.[A][ClearBox]You and that assassin, Katarina, spent your

battle against Akaneia, our enemy.[A][ClearBox]We will head to Pales, the hub of
Akaneia, to defeat Garnef, who

Dark Orb's control.[A][ClearBox]According to Lord Gato, Garnef is
gathering high class clerics, Princess Ellis
among them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]His objectives are unknown, but we must free
them quickly.[A][ClearBox]However, to reach Pales, we have to

By crossing the mountains, we avoided
pointless battles as much as we could.[A][ClearBox]We must defeat Garnef and rescue
Princess Ellis and the other kidnapped

MBTK_019_OUTLINE
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]We have come to Pales, the center of
Akaneia, with three objectives in mind.[A][ClearBox]To save Hardin from the Dark Orb.
Rescue the kidnapped clerics.
And defeat Garnef, the Demon King.[A][ClearBox]It seems there was a rebellion in Pales
not long ago. Citizens and knights rioted
against Hardin's actions[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]However, they were defeated, and now
await execution by Hardin.[A][ClearBox]Hardin has really changed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Prince Marth came here wanting to save
Hardin[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] But we might already be too late[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]No matter how many people would forgive
Hardin, or how many people would want him
to be freed from the Dark Orb[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]The cold, hard truth is that Hardin has
stolen the lives of many innocents.[A][ClearBox]It is unbearable to remember that he was
once our comrade[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_020_OUTLINE
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]We have seized control of Akaneia.

Now is the time for us to settle this.[A][ClearBox]Right now, there are many who wish for
Prince Marth to defeat Hardin and liberate
Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]But the prince seems bent on rescuing
Hardin from the clutches of the Dark Orb.[A][ClearBox]And we still have to defeat Garnef and
rescue the princess and the other clerics.[A][ClearBox]Many people are waiting for us.[Pause=3]

earth dragons slumber.[A][ClearBox]As you've no doubt heard, we must banish
the earth dragons.[A][ClearBox]If the countless earth dragons awaken,
we will witness hell on earth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Fortunately, the Dark Orb completed the
