[TargetRight]Sir Alan,[Pause=3]
there is something I want to ask of you.[A]
[ClearBox]Please teach me what it means to be a knight.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]To be a knight[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, sir.[A]
[ClearBox]What is it that really defines a knight?[Pause=3]
I've always pondered this.[A]
[ClearBox]Be it prowess, nobility or loyalty[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Each knight seems to have a[Pause=3] different
answer.[A]
[ClearBox]I want to know what you think,[Pause=3] Sir Alan.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]The way of the knight, huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Sadly, I can't teach you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Argh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] Cough[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Guh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Alan, are you all right?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes, this happens all the time.[Pause=3]
No need to fret.[A]
[ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39], before serving Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I used to be a wandering knight.[A]
[ClearBox]I have served two masters.[Pause=3]
I am not worthy to speak about what it
means to be a knight.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ARAN_C_2
[TargetRight]But, that's exactly why I wanted to
ask you, Sir Alan.[A]
[ClearBox]I've been thinking[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Perhaps there's more than one way to be
a knight[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A]
[ClearBox]Maybe each knight holds his own meaning[Pause=3]
in his or her heart.[A]
[ClearBox]I am inexperienced as a knight,[Pause=3] so I was
hoping you could help me find my way,
Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sorry, but I still haven't figured it out
for myself.[Pause=3]
I'm afraid I can't help you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] That's a pity.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ARAN_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ARAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Cough[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Guh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Gah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]ha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What's happening to you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Pull yourself together[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Somebody, please help[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sir Alan is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ARAN]Wait[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Please[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Don't tell the others.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]But, you look absolutely terrible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]This won't kill me.[Pause=3]
Not while this war rages.[Pause=3]
I swear it on my honor as a knight.[A]
[ClearBox]This will likely be my last war.[Pause=3]
I don't want to leave with any regrets.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Why are you pushing yourself so hard[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You asked me before[Pause=3] what it means
to be a knight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Long ago,[Pause=3] I went astray[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]This war[Pause=3] shall be my redemption.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]For a knight, sacrificing yourself for your
cause is the highest honor[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I beg of you.[Pause=3]
I'm sure you understand, as a fellow knight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes.[Pause=3]
If you are set on this[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I will not stop you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You have my thanks, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ARAN_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ARAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]It happened a long time ago,[Pause=3]
when I was a knight for my old kingdom.[A]
[ClearBox]There was a rebellion[Pause=3] and my liege ordered
me to suppress it.[A]
[ClearBox]But what I met was no army[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]They were poor peasants, unable to survive
the harsh winter due to the poor harvest.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]They didn't intend to fight.[Pause=3]
But, in order to survive[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] they had
no choice but to make themselves heard.[A]
[ClearBox]My liege understood that[Pause=3] and ordered me to
slay them to set an example.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]And I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] followed that order.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]I used to think absolute loyalty to one's
liege[Pause=3] was a knight's most important duty.[A]
[ClearBox]But, I was mistaken.[Pause=3]
So, I left my liege[Pause=3] and spent a long time
wandering[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]But[Pause=3] it wasn't your fault, Sir Alan.[Pause=3]
The one responsible for it was[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] can't forgive myself.[A]
[ClearBox]"I was just following orders[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It wasn't my fault[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]"[Pause=3][A]
[ClearBox]I could tell myself that endlessly,
but deep inside I'd never be convinced.
And it would not erase my sins.[A]
[ClearBox]I can't forgive myself more than anyone.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]A liege I could swear loyalty to
from the bottom of my heart[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A]
[ClearBox]I searched far and wide for such a liege[Pause=3]
and finally I found him.[A]
[ClearBox]Prince Marth is my liege.[Pause=3]
As long as I fight for him,[Pause=3]
I can be a true knight.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ARAN_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]So that's why you're fighting so hard
in this war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]I won't last long.[Pause=3]
I probably won't survive this war at all.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]But, I have no regrets.[A]
[ClearBox]A knight isn't a puppet that blindly follows
orders.[Pause=3]
That is not loyalty.[A]
[ClearBox]To fight for a cause I believe in,[Pause=3]
under a liege I believe in.[Pause=3]
That is what it means to be a knight.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Alan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Sir Alan, please[Pause=3] let me follow your path.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]After listening to your words,[Pause=3] I can now
see it clearly[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A]
[ClearBox]The path I must follow[Pause=3] as a knight.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BARTS_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BARTS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Hey, you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hm?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Unless I'm mistaken[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
You're [SpecialText0x14=0x39], aren't you?[Pause=3]
Yeah, you gotta be[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Well[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh yeah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] I'm Barts.[Pause=3]
Say, you're in pretty good shape[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Uh, yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]It makes sense, since you're a knight and all.[Pause=3]
You must have had a good teacher[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]My grandfather was my teacher.[Pause=3]
Thanks for the compliment.[A]
[ClearBox]But, you could tell that?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah.[Pause=3] I did all sorts of things after the
War of Darkness, y'see.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Wait, the War of Darkness?[A]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You mean to say you've fought alongside
Prince Marth before[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, I did. And?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Pardon my rudeness,[Pause=3]
um, Sir Barts[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Just call me Barts.[Pause=3]
See you later, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BARTS_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BARTS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Barts.[Pause=3]
I want to ask you a question.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, if it ain't [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What is it? Ask away.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You said you did all sorts of things[Pause=3]
after the War of Darkness.[A]
What things did you mean?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh, that.[A]
I don't mind telling you, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why do you want to know?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I was raised by my grandfather and I've
always aspired to be a knight.[A]
[ClearBox]I've never once considered doing anything
else with my life.[A]
[ClearBox]But you aren't a knight, so[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I got you curious, huh?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, a bit.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I see.[Pause=3]
Well, it ain't a very interesting tale,[Pause=3]
so don't complain to me later, OK?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Don't worry about it.[A]
[ClearBox]My grandfather used to say,[Pause=3]
"Nothing we do is in vain,"[Pause=3]
after all.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Heh, you really did have a good teacher[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
All right.[Pause=3] Listen up then, [Pause=3][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]First I got to talk about Talis.[A]
Then there's my stint in Akaneia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Wait,[Pause=3] I need to fit in my pirating days too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]P-pirating[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BARTS_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BARTS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's been a while![A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah, Barts.[Pause=3]
You told me your life story last time.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah.[Pause=3]
I ended up talking your ears off didn't I?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]There are so many[Pause=3] different ways to live
your life[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've had a lot to think about.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, I made you think. Ain't that funny[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So.[Pause=3]
What'd you decide to do with your life?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I will protect Prince Marth.[Pause=3]
No matter what.[A]
[ClearBox]If I protect him, he will change the world[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
That's how I feel.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Good answer[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's why I can trust my back to you.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_BARTS_A_2
[SpecialText0x14]Damn, I want[Pause=3] Maji and Saji to hear what
you just said[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Why?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]They've been in the mercenary business
too long.[A]
[ClearBox]I want to show them how to live[Pause=3]
when it's peaceful.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I see.[A]
[ClearBox]I wouldn't mind telling them.[A]
But, that's not[Pause=3] what you really want, is it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You want to teach them the ways of life by
living your own life as an example.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I can see it written on your face.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hahaha[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]You got me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're right, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]All right, let's end this battle already[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Then I can move on to the next part of
my life story[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, let's do just that[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_CECIL_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I have a favor to ask.[A]
[ClearBox]May I train with you?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Sure, I don't mind.[A]
[ClearBox]It won't be easy, though.
Are you all right with that?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course.[Pause=3]
You won't hear me complaining.[A]
[ClearBox]Also, let me make this clear:[Pause=3] don't go easy
on me just because I'm a woman.[Pause=3]
That would be an insult to me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Fair enough.[Pause=3]
Well said, Cecil.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm an Aritian knight, just like you.[Pause=3]
I expect the same rights as any other knight,[Pause=3]
and of course, the same responsibilities.[A]
[ClearBox]I hate being spoiled or favored because
I'm a woman.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You're strong, Cecil.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Not at all.[Pause=3]
That's the least thing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What's wrong?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]S-say, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Didn't you hear something?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm? No, not a thing.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]It sounded like a sad howl[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Aw,[Pause=3] I'm sure it's just the wind.[A]
[ClearBox]What's wrong, Cecil?[Pause=3]
You don't look too well[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I-I'm calling it a day.[Pause=3]
Training too much is bad for your body,
after all![A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]Cecil?[Pause=3]
But we haven't started training yet[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_CECIL_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]S-say, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]What's the matter?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Er[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Did you hear that rumor?[A]
[ClearBox]I-I don't believe it, but I'm just curious[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight]What rumor?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Y-you know[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
The rumor that there's a ghost haunting
this army[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Music=BGM_EVT_ENEMY3][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, that nonsense.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Nonsense[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
They say the ghost of a long-haired girl[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah, that was just some dry wood.
Someone was just seeing things.[A]
[ClearBox]It's just a joke at this point.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]A-ah, I see. Yes.[Pause=3]
Of course.[Pause=3]
There's no way it could have been a ghost[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Cecil,[Pause=3] don't tell me you're afraid of ghosts?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]N-no way[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Something like that couldn't possibly exist[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm not a child anymore[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Ghosts are silly.[Pause=3]
But just to be on the safe side[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_CECIL_B_2
[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Hm?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]What? Is something wrong?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Didn't you hear that strange sound, Cecil[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][Pause=3][Sound=SE_EVT_NOISE1][FreezeMouth]Huh?![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Kyaaaaaaa[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Cecil[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_GAG1][TargetLeft]W-where, where[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Where did it come from[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Where is it?[A]
[ClearBox]N-no[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Noooo[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Wait[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Calm down, Cecil.[A]
[ClearBox]I can't move with you clinging on to me like
this.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]B-but, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]It's t-the gho-ghost[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Begoooone vile spirit[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]

Listen to me[FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]M-my neck[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Stop squeezing my[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I can't[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] breathe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]

MBTK_CECIL_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Oh, er[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hi Cecil.[Pause=3]
About last time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Hey, wait. Please wait.[Pause=3]
Why are you trying to run away from me?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CECIL]L-last time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I really made a fool of myself.[A]
[ClearBox]And I was talking so proudly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Y-you can laugh all you want.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]So you have a weakness too, Cecil.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Y-yes I do, what about it[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]No matter how hard I try,[Pause=3]
I can't do anything if I'm afraid[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's my fault for being afraid[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That isn't a bad thing.[Pause=3]
That's just how you are.[A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetLeft]Say what[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_LOVE2]Everyone has their weaknesses.[Pause=3]
I'm the same.[A]
[ClearBox]And that goes for battle, too.[Pause=3]
None of us are perfect.[Pause=3]
That's why we have to work together.[A]
[ClearBox]So, you don't need to force yourself.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]That might be true.[A]
[ClearBox]I didn't want to fall behind.[Pause=3]
I didn't want to show my weakness.[Pause=3]
That's why I was always acting tough.[A]
[ClearBox]But, because you saw my weakness[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I think I can relax a bit now.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_CECIL_A_2
[TargetRight]I see. All is well, then.[A]
[ClearBox]But I have to say,[Pause=3] you can be
unexpectedly cute, Cecil.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]C-c-cu[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Cute[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
The way you screamed was[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Y-you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Erase it from your memory[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Take this[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]W-wait. Calm down.[Pause=3]
I was just saying[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I don't care, forget about what you saw,[Pause=3]
forget iiiit[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Take this, and this[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=DOHGA][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
How are things?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]P-perfect, sir[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You don't need to be so formal with me.[A]
[ClearBox]You're not an apprentice anymore.
Here, we are both comrades protecting
Prince Marth together.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes sir, understood.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]But Sir Doga, you truly are a humble man.[Pause=3]
Despite your strength and valor,[Pause=3] you don't
brag at all.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, I'm not that strong.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]No, Sir Doga, you are a hero.[Pause=3]
I'm from the countryside, so I wasn't wise
to the details before.[A]
[ClearBox]But now that I'm traveling the lands and
hearing stories about the previous war,[Pause=3]
I'm continually impressed.[A]
[ClearBox]They speak of Sir Doga the hero,[Pause=3] who
repelled all of his foes with his impenetrable
defense[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, rumors are often exaggerated.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Doga, I'll do my best every day to get
close[Pause=3] to your level[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, enthusiasm is good.[Pause=3]
Work hard, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_DOHGA_B
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=DOHGA][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Doga, I'd like to ask you something.[A]
[ClearBox]Can you teach me your legendary technique?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Legendary technique?[Pause=3]
I only know of normal techniques.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Doga, you are even more humble than I
thought.[Pause=3] You're a legendary hero, yet you
still won't boast at all[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Sir Doga,[Pause=3] I've heard the legends[Pause=3] about the
previous war.[A]
[ClearBox]Like how you took on hundreds of enemies
without so much as flinching.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Y-yeah.[Pause=3]
That sounds greatly exaggerated[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]And then, with a swing of your lance, you
blew the enemy army away to the skies.[A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_DOHGA_B_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Wait, what?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed][Music=BGM_EVT_GAG1]Then, to finish them, you took flight[Pause=3] and with
a strike of your lance, sent them flying far
from Akaneia.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No no, wait a minute.[Pause=3]
That's complete nonsense.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Truly.[Pause=3]
I don't think it's something a man could do.[Pause=3]
Unless that man is Sir Doga[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No no, I can't do it either.[A]
[ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39], [Pause=3]I'm happy that you hold me in high
esteem,[Pause=3] but those legends aren't true at all.[A]
[ClearBox]They've been exaggerated beyond belief.[Pause=3]
Are you truly suggesting I grew wings and
that's how I took flight[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]There's no need to be so modest, Sir Doga.[Pause=3]
You know such an amazing technique, but you
won't even admit it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Sir Doga,[Pause=3] please teach me[Pause=3] your technique[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I think we've a misunderstanding here.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_DOHGA_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=DOHGA][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75]
[TargetRight]Sir Doga,[Pause=3] about the training for your
legendary technique[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh yes. I asked you to lift up ten men with
your little finger[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]How did it go?[Pause=3]
You understand it's impossible now, right?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes sir, it is impossible for me right now.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Isn't it? Do you understand now, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[Pause=3]
The difference between legend and reality?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes. No matter how hard I try[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I can only lift three people[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]W-what[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]I am still no match for you, Sir Doga[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]But, if I continue training, I'm confident I'll
reach your level someday.[A]
[ClearBox]Sir Doga, I shall do my best.[Pause=3]
Until the day I can be on par with a
legendary hero like you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Those legends aren't real[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Hey, [SpecialText0x14=0x39], wait[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I need to explain something to you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm getting some extra training in.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm,[Pause=3] don't you get tired
from training all the time?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I need to do it to become stronger.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Hey,[Pause=3] now that I've had a good look at you,
you're not actually that bad-looking.[A]
[ClearBox]But you don't have much of a fashion sense;
you're just like Navarre in that way.[A]
[ClearBox]Here, check me out.[Pause=3]
My clothes are cute, aren't they?
See how they flutter in the wind?[A]
[ClearBox]You won't be popular with the girls
unless you're fashionable like I am.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I'd rather focus on my training, thanks.[A]
[ClearBox]Actually, I don't really like the way
you dress[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What's wrong with the way I dress?[Pause=3]
Tell me![Pause=3] Don't you find it cute?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]It's too thin and you're not
properly covered.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm not covered?[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=eh]Oh, so you like what you see, then?[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], you rascal![A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Um, no.[Pause=3] That's not what I meant.[Pause=3]
I just thought it wasn't suited for battle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Ohmigosh, are you embarrassed?[Pause=3]
Ooh! You're so cute![A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm not cute.[Pause=3]
Excuse me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]Hey, wait a second![A][ClearBox][X]

[ClearBox][TargetRight]What is it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You really do train every single day,
don't you?[A]
[ClearBox]How can you train all by yourself when
there's such a cute girl by your side?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I'll lose my competitive edge if I miss
a single day.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Tsk, you're so boring.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, right![Pause=3]
Hey, do you want to see my dance?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Your dance?[Pause=3]
Yes, gladly.[A]
[ClearBox]Your dance invigorates people, right?[Pause=3]
If you dance for me, I'll be able to
train twice as hard.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Do you want to see a normal dance
or a "special" dance?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]A special dance?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You see, my special dance...[Pause=3]
I've never shown it to a man before.[A]
[ClearBox]Because[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's very embarrassing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I-is that so?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
Because it's very revealing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I wouldn't mind showing it to you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_FINA_B_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]What[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]You're special to me, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
So even if it's embarrassing;[Pause=3]
if you want me to do it, then I will.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]So[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Do you want to see my special dance?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]N-no, I, er[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][Music=BGM_EVT_GAG1]Ahaha[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] It was a joke.[Pause=3]
Look at you, you've gone all red![A]
[ClearBox]There's no way I'd show it to you that easily.[Pause=3]
And you took me seriously![A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Y-you[FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]But it's fun to tease you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]![A]
[ClearBox]If you're annoyed, then how about you
tease me back?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Enough of this.[Pause=3]
I'm going back to my training.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]Oh, don't get angry at me.[Pause=3]
I was just teasing you![A]
[ClearBox]Hey, wait![A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_FINA_A

[ClearBox]So, how was it?[Pause=3]
Did you like my dance?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes,[Pause=3] I'm brimming with energy.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Are you happy that I'm here?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I am.[Pause=3]
When you're here, my training is far
more productive.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're just saying that!
It's really because I'm pretty, right?[A]
[ClearBox]You're always saying it's for your training,[Pause=3]
but truthfully you just enjoy spending time
with me, right?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]What?[UnfreezeMouth]
No way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Okay, perhaps.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Eh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_FINA_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_LOVE2][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]At first,[Pause=3] I thought you were annoying.[A]
[ClearBox]But after seeing you dance more and more[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Your dancing had[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
No, [Pause=3]you had charmed me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]S-so you mean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]I decided not to confess my feelings.[Pause=3]
After all, you would have laughed at me.[Pause=3]
But, I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetLeft]Oh, b-but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's still my first time doing this[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
So, um[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]

[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Eh?[A]
[ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_GAG1]Whaaaaat[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You asked me to tease you back, didn't you?[Pause=3]
So I did.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]Are you serious, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth]
I won't forgive you for this[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_KATUA_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATUA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Greetings.[Pause=3]
You are Prince Marth's Royal Guard[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], correct?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]And you are Dame Katua of the
Macedonian Whitewings[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Just Katua is fine, thanks.[Pause=3]
We're comrades, so I'd be happy if we
could talk normally between us.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]All right. I'd like that too.[A]
[ClearBox]We've already fought together for a while.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]That we have.[Pause=3]
I've seen you battle many times.[A]
[ClearBox]You fight with peerless devotion[Pause=3]
to protect Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Just as I'd expect from Prince Marth's
Royal Guard.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I'm honored.[Pause=3]
Thank you for your praise.[A]
[ClearBox]I've watched you fight, too.[Pause=3]
You're incredibly powerful.[Pause=3]
I admire you as a warrior.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Ha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] you embarrass me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]In the coming battles[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I bet we'll fight together many more times.[A]

MBTK_KATUA_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATUA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] about that last battle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I'm sorry.[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You had to save me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]It's fine, we're comrades after all.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]But you left yourself wide open in battle.[Pause=3]
That's not like you. Did something happen?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]N-no[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I just lack experience.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That's not true.[Pause=3]
If you fought with your full strength,[Pause=3]
you wouldn't need my help at all.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That reminds me.
Sometimes I'd see you just staring off
into the distance.[A]
[ClearBox]Were you[Pause=3] watching Prince Marth?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Ah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]N-no.[Pause=3]
It isn't like that! I was, uh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]You don't need to hide it, Katua.[Pause=3]
Prince Marth is a great man, after all.[A]
[ClearBox]Everyone is fighting in this army because
they admire Prince Marth.[Pause=3]
I'm no different.[A]
[ClearBox]You feel the same way, don't you?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Y-yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] That's right.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]For your sake as well, Katua,[Pause=3]
I must do my best as a Royal Guard.[A]
[ClearBox]I will become much stronger.[Pause=3]
For Prince Marth,[Pause=3] for you, and for all[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KATUA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Say, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Haven't you[Pause=3] been overdoing it lately?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]W-what do you mean?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I admire you for so fervently protecting
Prince Marth, but you've been pushing
yourself beyond your limits[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Katua.[Pause=3]
It looks like I couldn't hide it from you
after all.[A]
[ClearBox]Our enemies are becoming stronger.[Pause=3]
Protecting Prince Marth is not easy.[A]
[ClearBox]However, I promise you this:[Pause=3]
no matter what happens to me,
at least Prince Marth will be[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm not worried about Prince Marth,[FreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]I'm worried about you.[A]
[ClearBox]If you surrendered your life,[Pause=3]
even if to protect him[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm sure[Pause=3] he would be distraught.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Yes.
You're right. I might have been taking things
too far.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No matter what happens,[Pause=3]
I'm here if you need help.[A]
[ClearBox]We're comrades, after all.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Got it.[Pause=3] Thanks, Katua.[Pause=3]
You have my gratitude.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]It's okay.[Pause=3]
You've already helped me too, after all[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Hey, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Hm?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_KATUA_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]You see, there's something that was
bothering me for a long time...[A]
[ClearBox]Something I couldn't tell anyone.[Pause=3]
A forbidden feeling[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]A terrible burden deep within my chest,[Pause=3]
and I could do nothing to alleviate it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I hated it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] It was horrible.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]If you want to talk about it, I'll listen.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks.[Pause=3]
But right now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I feel a little better.[A]
[ClearBox]I believe it's probably thanks to you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Me?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You have always[Pause=3] been by my side.[A]
[ClearBox]We'd talk and[Pause=3] laugh together[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]We'd talk about Prince Marth and about
each other[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]And as we did[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Little by little,[Pause=3] my pain lessened.[A]
[ClearBox]As time passes,[Pause=3] then maybe, someday[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'll be able to forget it entirely[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?[Pause=3]
I don't really get it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's fine. You don't need to.[Pause=3]
Anyway, thank you[Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

Prince Marth.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Your dear prince?[Pause=3]
Well, he is a prince, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You see,[Pause=3] men are such disgusting creatures,
but Prince Marth is totally different.[A]
[ClearBox]He reached out to me,[Pause=3] gently, with his

[ClearBox]He even promised to marry me, right in
front of Granny[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Really?[Pause=3]
I find that difficult to believe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Oh, I remember when I close my eyes.[Pause=3]
As I was being pursued by bandits,
and cried for help[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Prince Marth came gallantly galloping to my

[ClearBox][TargetRight]My liege doesn't ride a white horse.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Let's not fuss over the details.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Oh yes, where should we hold our wedding?[A]
[ClearBox]Prince Marth might want it in Aritia,[Pause=3] but I
want Granny to see me in a wedding dress[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]And then, after the wedding[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
We'd look up at the night sky from the
castle's balcony, just the two of us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]And I'd say "Isn't it beautiful?"[Pause=3]
Then he would whisper into my ear,
"Not nearly as much as you are[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]"[A]
[ClearBox]And then, and then,[Pause=3] we'd kiss gently under

[ClearBox]Eeeeeek![Pause=3]
Silly Malliesia[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Um[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'm sorry to interrupt at such an

[ClearBox]He was just toying with me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I've heard the story.[A]
[ClearBox]You told Sir Jeigan you were going to marry
Prince Marth and asked to meet him
privately.[A]
[ClearBox]It's no surprise you made Sir Jeigan furious[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]But, Prince Marth looked at me with such
sparkling eyes.[A]
[ClearBox]And even Granny was fooled, too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Ohh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Prince Marth played with my pure,
innocent heart[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]What? No, that's not true.[Pause=3]
Stop making such outrageous claims.[A]
[ClearBox]I can't let you spread false rumors about
my liege.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]But, it was my first love[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sniff, sniff.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Don't cry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]

[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're right.[Pause=3]
What matters now is how Prince Marth
and I feel about each other![A]
[ClearBox]I won't give up just because that old sack

[ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, Malliesia.[A]
[ClearBox]I hear you've stopped sneaking into Prince
Marth's room.[Pause=3] That's one less thing for me
to worry about.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. Actually, I've been wondering.[A]
[ClearBox]How should I handle my feelings for
Prince Marth?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see you finally understand.[A]
[ClearBox]You let your imagination run wild[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]It's time to face reality, like an adult.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I'm already an adult[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I felt the same way back when I lived in my
village.[A]
[ClearBox]But, now that I've become a knight[Pause=3] and
fought all these battles[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I see clearly.[A]
[ClearBox]I was a child back then.[Pause=3]
I hadn't seen enough of the world.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Is that so?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, you're still young.[Pause=3]
You should think carefully about your life.[A]
[ClearBox]You will continue to mature[Pause=3] and gradually
become a much more charming woman.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Thank you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Say, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Where would[Pause=3] you like to hold our wedding?[A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][Music=BGM_EVT_GAG1]Prince Marth is out of my league,[Pause=3] but you're
strong and kind[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Maybe you could be my prince instead.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]When I'm afraid in battle,[Pause=3] you whisper to me[Pause=3]
"It's all right, I'm here by your side."[A]
[ClearBox]And then you embrace me tightly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Eeeeeek! Silly Malliesia[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]All right, all right.[Pause=3]

[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Enough already, you're always treating me
like a kid[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'm already a grownup![A]

[TargetRight]Sire,[Pause=3] are you departing?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hello, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
I was just heading to the armory.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You need not trouble yourself with such
a trivial chore, sire.[A]
[ClearBox]Speak the word, and I'll fetch as many
iron swords[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thanks, but I'll be fine.[Pause=3] I'm used to it.[Pause=3]
Besides, I want to affirm the situation with
my own eyes.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Then I shall accompany you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thank you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
But I'm just going to visit the armory.[Pause=3]
There's no need to bother you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I understand, sire. Still, it would be terrible
if anything were to happen to you.[A]
[ClearBox]It is my duty as your Royal Guard[Pause=3]
to protect you at all times.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You worry too much, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
But I appreciate it.[A]
[ClearBox]All right, let's go together.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, sire![A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Hello, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Are you doing anything?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, sire[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I am off to the drill grounds.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]The drill grounds?[Pause=3]
Then you must want more battle experience.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
My objective is to not merely win,[Pause=3]
but to attain a winning streak.[A]
[ClearBox]To win twice, then thrice in a row,[Pause=3]
fighting stronger enemies each time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]To learn the limit of my strength[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=3]
that excites me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're really looking forward to it.[Pause=3]
I can see it in your face.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed, sire[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What is it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_GRAVE1]There is something[Pause=3] I must tell you, sire.[A]
[ClearBox]My strength[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] exists for protecting the
people of our fair country.[A]
[ClearBox]To that end, I have continuously trained and
battled[Pause=3] so that I could become stronger.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I understand. But?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MARS_B_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] when I become stronger[Pause=3] and when
I fight opponents stronger than myself,[A]
[ClearBox]I get excited.
I begin to feel my blood boil[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]As if I sought[Pause=3] strength and battle for
my own sake.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]When I become stronger[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I bask in my newfound power.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Deep inside my heart[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I long for battle.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]"A man with untamed power is no better
than a beast,"[Pause=3] my grandfather once said.[Pause=3]
And I heed his warning.[A]
[ClearBox]If my lust for power causes me to stray
from the way of the knight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]It's all right, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox]Just like you're there for me,[Pause=3]
I am here for you.[A]
[ClearBox]You won't go down the wrong path.[Pause=3]
I'll make sure you don't. I promise.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're right.[A]
[ClearBox]With you here to guide me,[Pause=3] I will be fine.[A]
[ClearBox]You have my gratitude.[A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Why do you devote yourself to me
so strongly?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I am your Royal Guard.[Pause=3]
For you, sire, I[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I speak not of that.[Pause=3]
I know it's your duty.[A]
[ClearBox]I want to know more about you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]About me, sire[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]How long have you wanted to become
a knight of Aritia?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]For as long as I can remember, sire.[A]
[ClearBox]My grandfather has always wanted me
to become a knight.[A]
[ClearBox]I loved my grandfather,[Pause=3] so I endeavored to
live up to his expectations.[A]
[ClearBox]That's why I volunteered.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see. So it was your grandfather, then.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That is not the only reason.
Not any more.[A]
[ClearBox]I found another reason once I came to
Aritia Castle and met you, sire.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]When you met me?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[A]
[ClearBox]I have fought alongside you thus far.[A]
[ClearBox]Once I came to know you,[Pause=3]
I knew I wanted to fight for you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MARS_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]Sire.[Pause=3]
I devote myself to you,[Pause=3] for your sake,
not mine.[A]
[ClearBox]I am truly happy that you are my liege.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thank you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Hearing you say that makes me happier
than anything.[A]
[ClearBox]I am not a strong man.[Pause=3]
However, if you're here for me,
then I know we'll be victorious.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Let's end this war, alive.
Both of us. No matter what.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, sire[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MATIS_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MATIS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Oh no[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] What am I going to do?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?
Do you need help, Sir Machis?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm worried.
I'm so worried,[Pause=3] I can't stand still[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Worried about what?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, thanks for listening.[Pause=3]
You see, I'm can't stop thinking about
what's happening to Rena.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sister Rena[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
She disappeared with the others,
didn't she[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Rena is my little sister.[Pause=3]
My cute lil' sister has been kidnapped.[A]
[ClearBox]Our enemies are planning something wicked
for them. There's no doubt about that.[A]
[ClearBox]When I think about what they're doing to
Rena, I just can't help worrying[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Ahh, I can't stand it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I understand, Sir Machis.[Pause=3]
But you should try to calm down[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]There's no way I can calm down[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
She's as pure as the holiest maiden[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]And she's really cute, too.[Pause=3]
And she's been kidnapped[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Do you have any idea what she must be
going through[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Of course you don't[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
As her big brother, I can't let anything
happen to her[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]Wait, Sir Machis[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Just where are you going?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MATIS][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]To find Rena.
Except I got no clue where she is.[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But,[Pause=3] I'm not about to stand here
and just do nothing, mark my words[FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]Not again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MATIS_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MATIS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I'd like to ask you something.[Pause=3]
I wonder if you could help me get stronger?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You want to become stronger?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Me just standing here worrying isn't going
to help anyone[Pause=3] and I haven't the foggiest
idea where Rena even is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]But,[Pause=3] once I DO learn where she is, as her
big brother, it's my duty to save her[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]That's why I want to become strong.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see.[Pause=3]
That's a smart idea.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Think about it.[A]
[ClearBox]What if another man saved Rena?[A]
[ClearBox]If that happened, she would[Pause=3] probably start
falling for him, right?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Uh-huh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]So, if some creep tricked her[Pause=3]
and then dumped her[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Never[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
As her big brother, I can't let that
tragedy befall her[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]S-sir Machis[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MATIS]As her big brother, I must become stronger[Pause=3]
so I can protect her from all the creeps
lurking out there[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]I'll become the strongest man alive,
for Rena's sake[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Uh, all right.[Pause=3]
I'll help you out, if I can.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Good, I'm counting on you.[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But, I'd prefer it if it didn't
involve too much physical exercise.[Pause=3]
I don't want to get hurt, see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MATIS_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MATIS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, if it isn't [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Machis[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What happened to your training?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, I gave that up.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Already[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, it was impossible from the beginning.[Pause=3]
Everyone has things they can and can't do.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]The truth is,[Pause=3] I don't think I could ever
beat you.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Actually, that's what I wanted to ask
you about.[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], I'd like you to do it for me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Do what?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm sure I can trust Rena to you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]W-wait...[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You've helped me out a bunch.[Pause=3]
I can tell you're a nice guy.[A]
[ClearBox]So,[Pause=3] I wouldn't mind being your big brother.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]No, thanks.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't be shy, little brother.[A]
[ClearBox]Come on, let's rescue Rena together[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Though you'll be doing most of the work[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[ClearBox]Oh, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3] Since we're comrades,[Pause=3]
could we drop the formalities?[A]
[ClearBox]We're about the same age and it'd be nice if
I could talk normally to new knights like you.[A]

[ClearBox]Yeah, your way's best.[Pause=3]
Is this okay, Norne?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, that's the spirit.[A]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=NORN][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So, I met Prince Marth when he was
escapin' from Aritia.[A]
[ClearBox]Bein' an archer,[Pause=3] I decided it was my duty
to fight for him.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's what happened.[Pause=3]
At that time, I was still studying day and
night back in my village[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]What village might that be, [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sera. It's fairly small.[A]

You mean the one just over the mountain
from my own village?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What, really?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hold on.[A]
[ClearBox]Say [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] did you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Did you ever carry firewood to our village
when you were little?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Carry firewood to other villages?[Pause=3]
Yes, I did it for my grandfather[Pause=3] when I was
a child.[A]
[ClearBox]He would have me do it sometimes[Pause=3] instead
of my usual marching training.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I see, it all makes sense now.[Pause=3]
So the strong little boy was you.[Pause=3]
You were rather famous back in our village.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]How nostalgic![Pause=3]
To think that I'd meet you again here[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]When you were little,[Pause=3] you had a pair of

[ClearBox]I see.[Pause=3]

[ClearBox]There was one time when you played with us,
as children.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm afraid I don't.[A]
[ClearBox]All I remember of my childhood days[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
was my grandfather pushing me to my limits.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I see.[Pause=3]
That's a shame[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]I volunteered to join the Aritian army[Pause=3]
because I had met you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Really? You did?[A]

[ClearBox]One time, I got lost[Pause=3] in the forest and was

but you did your best to comfort me.[A]
[ClearBox]"It's okay, I'm here.[Pause=3]
I'll show you the way back."[Pause=3]
You were really reliable.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Did I say that?[Pause=3]
I'm afraid I've no sense of direction[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Hee hee, yes, that's right.[Pause=3]
You were lost too,[Pause=3] so we didn't know what
to do.[A]
[ClearBox]But, you stayed by my side[Pause=3] until the adults
found us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, I think I'm starting to remember now.[Pause=3]
So that was you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You've always said you wanted to become

[ClearBox]When I met you,[Pause=3] I decided I wanted to serve
my country, too.[A]

[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see. Life is full of unexpected turns[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]And[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]I thought that if I joined the Aritian army[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
then maybe I'd meet you again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] E-er[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
N-nothin'.[Pause=3]
Maybe I said too much[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]We're just talking about our childhood[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
so don't mind me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]O-okay.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]
[FaceCommand=0x73]Ahaha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]

[ClearBox][TargetRight]The truth is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I thought I wasn't[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
training hard enough.[A]
[ClearBox]So I decided to train five times harder[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]

Then it's no wonder you collapsed.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I-it's okay.[A]

[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes ma'am.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, that's more like it.[A]
[ClearBox]You won't get strong[Pause=3] if you force yourself
to train too hard.[Pause=3]
You need to understand your limits.[A]
[ClearBox]Here's some water.[Pause=3]
Please have some.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]T-thank you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'll get more if you need it,[Pause=3] just ask.[A]
[ClearBox]But that's enough training for now.[Pause=3]
Do you hear me?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_PAORA_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=PAORA][LoadBackground=BBG75]
[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Ah, Dame Paola.[Pause=3]
Thanks for helping me the other day.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]No, I was interfering[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Please forgive me.[A]
[ClearBox]I can't help but care for people[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's a terrible habit of mine.[A]
[ClearBox]My sisters told me to stop doing it, too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That reminds me.[Pause=3]
Out of the three sisters of Macedonia,
esteemed heroines of the previous war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]You're the eldest of them, right,
Dame Paola?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
Since our parents died when we were young,[A]
[ClearBox]I had to accept the task of raising
my sisters.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[A]
[ClearBox]Dame Paola, you are, if I may say it,[Pause=3]
a very kind person.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thank you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've never thought of it that way.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh, by the way, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I was wondering.[A]
[ClearBox]Is your left shoulder all right?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh? Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're right, it is feeling rather stiff.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I knew it.[Pause=3]
Don't you think you're overdoing it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]It's fine. My grandfather used to tell me,
"If your body hurts, heal it with[Pause=3] training."[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_PAORA_B_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Oh my gosh, that's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It would be terrible if you hurt yourself
by training too hard.[A]
[ClearBox]Show it to me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]D-dame Paola[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Here[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] stay still.[A]
[ClearBox]If I massage your shoulder like this,
it'll relieve the pain.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]T-thanks[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Just try to relax[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Y-yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[Pause=3]
Are you turning red[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]N-no[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
T-that's just, um...[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_PAORA_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=PAORA][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75]
[TargetRight]Dame Paola.
Thanks for helping me the other day[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] again.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I hope I wasn't cramping your style[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]
[TargetRight]Not at all.[Pause=3]
You were a great boon.[A]
[ClearBox]Thanks to you,[Pause=3] I can become even stronger.[Pause=3]
And be of greater assistance to
Prince Marth.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], you really do your best for
Prince Marth, don't you?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes. You speak of my duty[Pause=3] and my desire.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]You're a good knight,[Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]D-dame Paola[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, sorry.[Pause=3] I wasn't thinking[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Do you not like being patted on the head?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]No, it's just that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You surprised me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I ended up[Pause=3] thinking of you as a
little brother[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Now that I think about it, I've been
treating you like I do my sisters.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Haha, you reminded me[Pause=3] of grandfather,
back in my childhood.[A]
[ClearBox]Dame Paola,[Pause=3] if it isn't a problem, could you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Help me with my training from now on, too?[A]
[ClearBox]If you're around,[Pause=3] I feel like I can work
even harder.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, gladly.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_RINDA_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RINDA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I don't believe we've been introduced.
I am [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] Prince Marth's Royal Guard.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I am Linda,[Pause=3] daughter of Archbishop Miroa.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Archbishop Miroa?[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Is he famous?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Wow, you don't know Father?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]No, I don't[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sorry.[Pause=3]
Please forgive my ignorance[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=3]
I come from the country.[A]
[ClearBox]Though I'm sure he's a great man.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]He is. There's not a soul in Akaneia who
doesn't know Father.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]He was a wonderful pontifex, respected
by everyone.[A]
[ClearBox]I've always wanted to be like him[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see.[Pause=3]
He sounds like someone I'd like to meet.[Pause=3]
Is he in Akaneia right now?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]He passed away.[Pause=3]
Killed by the Demon King, Garnef.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] My condolences.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's fine. Don't worry.[Pause=3]
What about your family?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_RINDA_C_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]I don't have one anymore.[A]
[ClearBox]I used to have my grandfather, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
he's gone, too.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh.[Pause=3]
I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]No, it's fine.[A]
[ClearBox]How should I put it[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's a draw[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
We're square[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]We're even?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, that works.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Tee hee[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] You're funny.[A]
[ClearBox]Very well, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].
It was nice meeting you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]The pleasure is mine.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_RINDA_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RINDA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]
Hey, Linda.[Pause=3]
You're just in time.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]For what?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I found some strawberries on the mountain,[Pause=3]
so I picked them.[A]
[ClearBox]They look good, don't they?[Pause=3]
Have some.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Pardon? These are strawberries?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Don't tell me you've never eaten one?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]O-of course I have.[A]
[ClearBox]But, the strawberries I ate back in the
palace with Princess Nina[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]They were bright red and beautiful.[A]
[ClearBox]These are misshapen and the color is off.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Really?[Pause=3]
The ones you find in the wild usually look
like this, you know.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]They do?[Pause=3]
I was raised in Pales, so I'm not
familiar with nature[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sorry for being a bumpkin.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh well.[Pause=3]
Here, try one.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Ah, thank you.[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]How is it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's good[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It tastes much better than the ones
I had in Pales.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I know, right?[Pause=3]
That's because it's fresh.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_RINDA_B_2
[TargetLeft]You're amazing.[Pause=3]
Say, can I go with you to the mountain
next time?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I don't mind, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's dangerous to climb a mountain
dressed like you are.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]How so?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Well,[Pause=3] your robe looks rather thin.[A]
[ClearBox]If it got stuck in the tree branches,
it might get torn.[Pause=3]
And if that happened[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hey, why are you looking away like that!?[Pause=3]
Y-you're[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] making me feel undignified![A]
[ClearBox]Father gave me this sacred robe.[Pause=3]
I'm not ashamed of it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I-I see. I'm sorry.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_RINDA_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RINDA][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Here, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox]I want to give you this.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]This is, um[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's a good-luck charm.
This kind is very popular in Pales town.[A]
[ClearBox]It's supposed to protect[Pause=3] its wearer
from tragedy.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh? Are you sure[Pause=3] you want to give me
something so expensive?[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]If you want more strawberries,[Pause=3]
I can just go get some for you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hey[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Do you really think I'm giving you this
in exchange for strawberries?[A]
[ClearBox]I'm giving it to you because[Pause=3] you always
protect[Pause=3] me in the battlefield.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Right, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]We're in this together, aren't we?[Pause=3]
I wouldn't have been able to get this far
without your help, either.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Why do you[Pause=3] protect me?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Neither of us[Pause=3] has a family anymore[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's why.[A]
[ClearBox]So when I saw you fighting[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I not sure how to say it, but[Pause=3] I knew I had to
protect you.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_RINDA_A_2
[TargetLeft]I see.[Pause=3] I feel the same way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
And that's why I wanted to protect you.[A]
[ClearBox]It's funny the way things turn out.[Pause=3]
I had no idea it would happen[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]And yet, we both came to feel this way[Pause=3]
after fighting together[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Linda[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]S-so, that's why[Pause=3] I'm giving you this.[Pause=3]
You face the most danger in battle.[A]
[ClearBox]So stop being shy and take it![A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see.
In that case, I'll gladly accept it.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You had better cherish it too![A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, of course I will.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_RODY_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75]
[TargetRight]Hahh, hahh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RODY][TargetLeft]What's going on? What are you doing here?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]Ah![UnfreezeMouth]
Uh, no-nothing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]What's that paper you're holding?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][Sound=SE_EVT_PAPER1][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]It's a rough map of the area.[Pause=3]
I thought it would be a smart idea to
take a look around.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And then you got lost.[Pause=3]
That reminds me, you got lost once during
our apprentice days, didn't you?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I did.[Pause=3]
I caused trouble for you guys back then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't you have any sense of direction?[Pause=3]
Come on, let's head back.[Pause=3]
Sir Jeigan is looking for you.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Say, Rody.[Pause=3]
If you look at my map, where exactly are we
right now?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I don't think that map is of this area.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_RODY_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RODY][LoadBackground=BBG75][Sound=SE_EVT_SIGN1][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], what are you doing?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I'm going through my belongings.[Pause=3]
I was going to get rid of some tools I no
longer use and books I've finished reading.[A]
[ClearBox]When I first volunteered to be a knight,
I imagined I would always travel lightly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's a lot of stuff.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah, I've gradually picked up a lot of
items since then, and I only just noticed
how bad the situation's gotten.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]These books look difficult[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Have you read them?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, all of them.[Pause=3]
Strategy and tactics are always important,
after all.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see.[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Can I have them?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh? Sure, I don't mind.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you.[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Well, see you later.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[Pause=3]
Sure, I'll see you at the war council.[A]
[ClearBox][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.
You're not just coasting on talent.[A]
[ClearBox]You're putting in all of this effort every
day, aren't you[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_RODY_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RODY][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], what are you doing here again?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[Pause=3]
Oh, I just thought a change of scenery
would help heal my spirit[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You don't need to hide the fact that you're
lost from me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Haha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sorry.[Pause=3]
You got me.[A]
[ClearBox]How do you find your way around so easily[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
First, I look for distinct landmarks.[A]
[ClearBox]Then, I use them to draw a map in my mind.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]All right. I'll try that.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]But the most important thing is this:[Pause=3]
if you're lost, ask someone.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]There are other things you can rely on.[Pause=3]
Like us.[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]If you're not sure if the army is going in
the right direction, you must inform us
straightaway.[A]
[ClearBox]We can't afford to ALL get lost.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Man, you're never going to let me forget
about that, are you[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] thanks, Rody.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SAJI_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SAJI][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75]
[TargetRight]You are[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sir Saji, right?[Pause=3]
Or are you Sir Maji?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hey, I'm Saji.[Pause=3]
Look properly before you talk next time![A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see. Sorry.[Pause=3]
You two look alike, after all.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Alike?[Pause=3] Hey, gimme a break.[Pause=3]
I'm completely different from that dude.[A]
[ClearBox]True, we're both mercenaries from Talis,[Pause=3]
and we're both woodcutters.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see you talk alike, too.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Well, I guess.[Pause=3]
But we're totally different.[Pause=3]
For instance, err[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]That's right, our faces[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've got the more handsome face,
doncha agree?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Handsome[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, take a goood look at my face.[Pause=3]
He can't deny it, either.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Just remember Saji's the handsome one![Pause=3]
Then you can't go wrong. Simple![A]
[ClearBox]So yeah,[Pause=3] don't get us mixed up again.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SAJI_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SAJI][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]That Maji can be a really reckless dude[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]A long time ago, back when we fought
together,[Pause=3] a nearby village was about to be
ransacked by bandits or something.[A]
[ClearBox]That time, he tried to save the village alone.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]How noble of him.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]But there were too many of them.[Pause=3]
There's no way he could've beat them alone.[A]
[ClearBox]But he just dove right in without thinking.
He's such a pain in the ass.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]And what did you do, then?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hm? Well,[Pause=3] I could've just let him get himself
killed, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]I'd probably have trouble sleeping at night,
if I did that.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]So you protected the village together
with Maji.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, I couldn't just leave him.[Pause=3]
It's not like I had a choice.[A]
[ClearBox]I can't abandon a comrade.[Pause=3]
You know that feeling, doncha?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I'd never abandon a comrade either.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, so you do get it.[Pause=3]
I could get along with you.[Pause=3]
Too bad I can't say the same of Maji.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SAJI_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SAJI][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]But y'see,[Pause=3] that Maji is really an
annoying dude[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Even if I wanted to, I can't get rid of him.[Pause=3]
He's always been my pal, see.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Somehow, you both[Pause=3] recognize each other's
worth.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Nonsense. You're kidding me, right?[A]
[ClearBox]When we meet, we fight all the time.[A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But, even that dude has got one
good point.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]His sense of justice.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Sense of justice[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right.[Pause=3]
He's got a real strong sense of duty.[Pause=3]
You know what I mean?[A]
[ClearBox]If he sees somebody weak being bullied,
he'll help them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] That kinda courage.[Pause=3]
He's got that.[A]
[ClearBox]Even this time,[Pause=3] he volunteered at the first
opportunity[Pause=3] when he heard Prince Marth
was in trouble.[A]
[ClearBox]'Cause he's like that,[Pause=3] it makes me feel like
tagging along too.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]So in the end, you really do recognize[Pause=3]
each other's worth.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]N-nonsense.
Were you even listening to me?[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SEAZER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]Caesar[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Oh, are you reading?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I am. [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] right?[A]
[ClearBox]You're not disturbing me.[Pause=3]
It's a book I've read many times already.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You seemed to be engrossed in it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What kind of book is it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's a book about tactics.[Pause=3]
As the leader of a group[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I figured I should enhance myself.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]The platoon I lead is[Pause=3] far smaller than
an army, but tactics is still important.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Nonetheless[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I felt my blood run cold in that battle.[A]
[ClearBox]Your mercenary company was meant to be
no match for a proper army, [Pause=3]but it was like
fighting a unit of elite one-man armies.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Though you still beat us in the end.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_C_2
[TargetRight]That's because[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Prince Marth carefully
selected our numbers and equipment[Pause=3] and
made the best preparations he could.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Exactly.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]The victor[Pause=3] is often decided before the
battle starts.[A]
[ClearBox]Prince Marth prepared himself to win.[Pause=3]
We could not.[Pause=3]
That difference decided the outcome.[A]
[ClearBox]The tactics used later[Pause=3] were mere details.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Is that written[Pause=3] in that book?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That sounds interesting[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
May I have a look?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sure.[Pause=3]
You can return it once you're done.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SEAZER][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Hey, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
How is the book going?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I started reading, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]There are many words I don't recognize,
so I'm having trouble.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, I forgot to warn you.
That book originates from another continent.
It's no surprise you find it hard to read.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Where did you get it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Have you ever been to Warren?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]No. I know it's a port city, though.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]My base is in Warren.[Pause=3]
Ships from all over the world go there.[A]
[ClearBox]I got the book as a reward for escorting
a foreign ship[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] basically.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]So you can understand their language?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, with no trouble.[A]
[ClearBox]After all, mercenaries do more than just
fight in wars.[A]
[ClearBox]I often escort people, too[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
all sorts of people.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]You're quite knowledgeable[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It appears there's more to a mercenary's
way of life than I thought[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SEAZER][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75]
[TargetRight]Do you have a family back in Warren?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I have a little sister.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]A sister, how nice.[Pause=3]
Is she all right without you?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, it's rather complicated, you see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
[Pause=3]My sister[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] is sick.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Her life won't be in danger as long as
she takes her medicine, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
The medicine is expensive.[A]
[ClearBox]I couldn't pay for it with just the salary
I earned at my old job in Warren,[Pause=3] so
I had to look for faraway work like this.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Then you must return[Pause=3] home alive,
for your sister's sake as well.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah. And I'm counting on you[Pause=3] to make that
happen, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], I believe you are[Pause=3] the cornerstone
of this army.[A]
[ClearBox]It's not just because you're Marth's Royal
Guard.[Pause=3] It's pretty clear to anyone who sees
you in battle.[A]
[ClearBox]The way you fight will decide the outcome
of this war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's how I see it.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Suffice to say, Prince Marth isn't the
only one relying on you.[A]
[ClearBox]I know I'm asking too much, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], that is why[Pause=3] I'll lend you my strength.[A]
[ClearBox]In peace and in war.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]You have my thanks, Caesar.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No need for thanks.[Pause=3] I am a mercenary[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Ultimately, I only think of my own profit.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]So, don't be shy.[Pause=3]
Feel free to ask me if there's anything
I can do for you.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SIRIUS_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Hm, you are[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox]And no need to tell me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're Sir Sirius.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed.[A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hmph,[Pause=3] you're a rude fellow.[A]
[ClearBox]That murderous hatred[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Is it directed at me?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That's right.[Pause=3]
I don't trust you one bit.[A]
[ClearBox]First of all, you hide your face and identity.[A]
"Sirius" isn't even your real name, is it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]What makes me most suspicious is your
stance. You never leave any openings.[Pause=3]
I can tell you're a warrior of great renown.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]You speak of my defensive stance[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
That's perfectly natural in a battlefield.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Don't change the subject.[A]
You are no mere knight[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Who the hell are you?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]What will you do if I don't answer?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Prince Marth is very kind.[Pause=3]
However, I know there are scoundrels who
would take advantage of his kindness.[A]
[ClearBox]I shall protect Prince Marth from these
villains,[Pause=3] at all costs.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]It seems we won't be able to solve this
with words alone.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]My thoughts exactly.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then, here I come.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][Pause=4][Sound=SE_EVT_DMG1][Pause=3]
Wha[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][EyeCommand=eh]You're too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] fast.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][TargetLeft]Be at peace.[Pause=3]
It was a blunt strike.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Kuh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SIRIUS_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Sirius[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39], was it?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I was most rude to you the other day.[Pause=3]
Please forgive me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]I can see from the way you fight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
that you are a true knight.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, the fault is not yours.[Pause=3]
Please raise your head.[A]
[ClearBox]I deliberately provoked the fight[Pause=3]
so that I could test you.[A]
[ClearBox]It is I who was at fault.[Pause=3]
I wish to ask for your forgiveness.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Wha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Sir Sirius, what are you[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Your actions the other day were virtuous,[Pause=3]
and befitting of a knight.[A]
[ClearBox]I know a man[Pause=3] who brought forth great
tragedy[Pause=3] because he was unable to do
what you did.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sirius?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
I'll answer the question you asked me
the other day.[A]
[ClearBox]My true name is[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]No, Sir Sirius.[Pause=3]
Do not concern yourself.[A]
[ClearBox]I'm sure I'd be better off[Pause=3] not knowing
your true identity, right?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]Ah![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I've come to understand you, thanks to
that encounter.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Indeed, there is no way someone Prince
Marth accepted[Pause=3] could be an evil man.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Sir Sirius.[Pause=3]
I am counting on you from now on.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I am in your debt.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SIRIUS_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Sirius.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]It looks like you're maintaining your weapons.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right.[Pause=3]
My weapon once broke during a mission[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Since then, I've been ever vigilant.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh?[Pause=3]
So even someone as skilled as you made
a simple error like that once[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]?[A]
[ClearBox]Was it some kind of special mission?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[A] I had to escort someone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
or rather, help her escape into exile.[A]
[ClearBox]I had to protect a lone bishop,
together with a few other soldiers[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
as we crossed a bandit-filled mountain.[Pause=3][A]
[ClearBox]That was the plan.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]That sounds quite difficult.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
The main problem was[Pause=3] that there were
simply too many enemies.[A]
[ClearBox]If my mighty lance[Pause=3] were to break,
it'd be all over.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] that's true.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, that's one reason[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]But there's another reason I need to
take care of my weapon.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[Pause=3]
And what would that be?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]I can't risk a surprise attack[Pause=3] from a knight
overzealous in his devotion to his liege.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Gah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm sorry about that.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Haha, how rude of me.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SIRIUS_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Wait[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
There's someone here[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39], behind you[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]What[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth] Kuh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][Sound=SE_EVT_ARROW2]Look out[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]

[ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][Pause=6][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Did[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] you save me?[A]
[ClearBox]It seems the assailant[Pause=3] has fled.[A]
[ClearBox]I am in your debt.[Pause=3]
If you hadn't helped me, I'd be[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][FreezeMouth]Ah![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sir Sirius, your mask[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I want you to forget what you just saw.[A]
We'll be even, then.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I understand.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_WENDEL_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WENDEL][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So, in other words, the Star Orb broke
into twelve pieces[Pause=3] and those pieces are the
star shards.[A]
[ClearBox]Each of them has a name and effect
associated with one of the twelve
constellations.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Interesting.[Pause=3]
Lord Wendel, you really do know everything
don't you?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's not true. I only know what Lord Gato
taught me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]But[Pause=3] you know almost as much as he does,
right?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]No[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Not nearly that much.[A]
[ClearBox]Lord Gato stands on an entirely different
level to me.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Is that so?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.
Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] what do you think about
Lord Gato?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Let me see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]He uses magic to talk to us from afar,
and he appears in the sky without warning.[A]
[ClearBox]I'd say he's a rather odd individual[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Yeah, I think that sounds right.[A]
[ClearBox]It would benefit us all if he could fight
alongside us without being so showy
and mysterious.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]G-good heavens[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You go too far, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Do you understand how rude you sounded[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Lord Gato is[Pause=3] like a deity to all us humans.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Really?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
I must tell you about him in proper detail[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_WENDEL_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WENDEL][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39], do you know the story
of the hero Anri?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Why, of course.[Pause=3]
He was Prince Marth's great ancestor,[Pause=3]
and the first King of Aritia.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, and the savior of the world who
vanquished Mediuth with the divine sword
Falchion.[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Anri received the Falchion from
the Sage of the North[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]None other[Pause=3] than Lord Gato himself.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's how[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
[A][ClearBox]Then, that means Lord Gato[Pause=3] saved our
ancestors and, by extension, all of us.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, and during the War of Darkness,[A]
[ClearBox]the one who guided Prince Marth[Pause=3]
and gave him the Starlight tome needed
to defeat the Demon King Garnef[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]That was, once again,[Pause=3] Lord Gato.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]S-so that's how[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Then, that means Lord Gato[Pause=3] saved Prince
Marth's life,[Pause=3] and therefore my own.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_WENDEL_B_2
[TargetLeft]Yes, yes.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]But, there's something I don't understand.[Pause=3]
Why does he ask us to come to him[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Since he can move around freely[Pause=3] with his
magic, he could come to us instead.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Lord Gato has to test us.[A]
[ClearBox]We must all be prepared[Pause=3] to save this world,
no matter what obstructs us.[A]
[ClearBox]Anyone who is not worthy won't be able to
wield the power Lord Gato offers.[Pause=3]
That is why a test is necessary.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[Pause=3]
So Lord Gato has his reasons[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]He wasn't just a weird old man[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course not.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_WENDEL_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WENDEL][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] I have told you how Lord Gato
has saved Aritia multiple times,[A]
[ClearBox]but naturally, he has done[Pause=3] far more than
just that.[A]
[ClearBox]The magic we study in Khadein[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]That magic was given to men[Pause=3]
by Lord Gato himself.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Magic itself[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. Were it not for Lord Gato,[Pause=3]
there would be no magic in this world.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]T-that's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That is amazing beyond belief[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Originally, Lord Gato gave magic to
mankind in order to help us.[A]
[ClearBox]He was saddened to see it later
used as a tool for war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Not just powerful,[Pause=3] but benevolent too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]I'm awestruck by his magnificence.[Pause=3]
Lord Gato is truly an astonishing person.[A]
[ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F64][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
Do you understand now?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_WENDEL_A_2
[TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_DAILY1]Yes, I am ashamed of my past ignorance.[A]
[ClearBox]Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Forgive me for thinking you were just
a weird old man[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes yes,[Pause=3] that's good of you.[A]
[ClearBox]Lord Gato sees all.[A]
[ClearBox]He has surely heard[Pause=3] your words just now.[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Thank you, Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Please keep on protecting us[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's quite all right, he can hear you.
You don't need to shout so loudly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Pay attention, and do not laugh.[Pause=3]
I have something[Pause=3] I must say.[A]
[ClearBox]I want[Pause=3] to thank you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Thank me? For what?[A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't you remember?[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]When Lang was about to take us from
Grunia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] you tried to save us.[A]
[ClearBox]You said this to Prince Marth:[Pause=3]
"Sire! I can still save them![Pause=3]
Please, just give me the word![FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]"[A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, I did[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]After Lawrence died[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] we had no allies.[A]
[ClearBox]There was no one we could turn to.[Pause=3]
It felt like the whole world was against us.[A]
[ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]But, when I heard your words[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I knew there were still people who would
fight for us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Thanks to your words[Pause=3]
I was able to stay strong,[Pause=3]
even when Lang kept us imprisoned[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]

[ClearBox]But Princess,[Pause=3] I think it'll be fine for us
