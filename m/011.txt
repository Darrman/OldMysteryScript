[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG29][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][TargetRight]Jeigan, where in the world are we[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN]This is the death desert of Marmotord.
There was a story depicted in the Anri Saga.[A][ClearBox]The first obstacle in Anri's Way:[Pause=3]
The Desert of Death.[A][ClearBox]With its scorching sun, raging sandstorm,
savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns
that soar and dominate the skies.[A][ClearBox]As the city of illusion shimmers in the
distance, we can only stand and gaze[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Or so the legend has it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So Anri came through here as well.[Pause=3]
And by himself, too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right. Your ancestor and Aritia's
founder, King Anri[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]To save Princess Artemis,[Pause=3] he set out on a
journey to seek the divine sword Falchion.[A][ClearBox]It's a long story, but I'll tell you the
legend of Anri.[A][ClearBox]A century ago... The Holy Kingdom
of Akaneia, governor of this continent,
was ravaged by the dragonkin.[A][ClearBox]The people back then lived days
of misery, as the dragons' slaves.[A][ClearBox]Some people wielded weapons to fight
back, but they couldn't defeat the dragon
tribe, and many people died.[A][ClearBox]House Akaneia, the people's only hope,
was eradicated, and the world descended
into despair.[A][ClearBox]But, at the time, there were rumors of an
Akaneian princess hiding out in Aritia,[A][ClearBox]which back then was no more than a provincial
town among many.[A][ClearBox]The furious Durhuan Empire sent troops to
Aritia, demanding the princess's extradition.[A][ClearBox]That princess - Artemis - planned to sacrifice
her own life in order to save the citizens.[A][ClearBox]However, the people of Aritia protected
her, and vowed to fight, knowing they
would be massacred.[A][ClearBox]Thanks to the heroic people of Aritia who stood
up to protect the princess, the people of
Akaneia came to know she was alive,[A][ClearBox]and resumed their battle against Durhua.[A][ClearBox]Their liberation army was led by
Duke Cartas, who fought with the royal
shield given to him by Artemis.[A][ClearBox]As a result, he received enormous support.
Thanks to their efforts, the tides of
battle turned to their favor.[A][ClearBox]However, the king of the earth dragons,
Mediuth, finally decided to make his move.[A][ClearBox]The dark breath of earth dragons possessed
horrendous destructive power and had the
effect of halving the enemy's strength.[A][ClearBox]Before his overwhelming might, it seemed
like Aritia's resistance wouldn't
last any longer.[A][ClearBox]But then, a sage appeared before them.
He spoke of a divine sword enshrined in
the ice shrine in the distant north.[A][ClearBox]With that blade, it would be possible to
fell Mediuth, but the way to obtain it
would be by no means easy...[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So Anri, to save his beloved Artemis,
left on a journey to obtain the sword?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, that's right.
But I think that's enough for today.
We still have a long road ahead of us...[A][ClearBox][X]
