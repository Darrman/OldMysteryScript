can't find any information.[A][ClearBox]So, apologies, but I can't help you rescue
your princess.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, it's alright.
We should be able to save Minerva by

priest prowling around lately.[A][ClearBox]It seems that somehow, Rena was taken by
this man.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]A priest[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Julian, as it turns out, Princess Maria has
gone missing as well.
I have a terrible feeling about this.[A][ClearBox]Anyway, staying here won't solve anything.[Pause=3]

[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=WOMAN2][LoadBackground=BBG26]Have you noticed that large drawbridge
behind this village?[A][ClearBox]Normally it's separated by the river, but if
you use this key here, you can cross the
bridge.[A][ClearBox]Just, once you cross the drawbridge, the
enemies on the other side will come and
attack you at once.[A][ClearBox]If you want to advance safely,
you might be better off taking the long 
detour that goes right around the mountain.
[A][ClearBox]Here, take the key.[Pause=3]
No matter which path you take,

Princess Maria is nowhere to be found[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]On top of that, they say that Princess
Minerva has been captured and that her
life is in peril.[A][ClearBox]I just hope[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] that this country doesn't end
