A miracle finally occurred.[A][ClearBox]He was a giant who became our guardian god.[Pause=3]

the evildoers were silenced.[A][ClearBox]When light from his shield radiated,[Pause=3]
the evil ones returned to stone.[A][ClearBox]The god created a new age.[Pause=3]
Dragons lived as humans and the evil ones

saved humanity and gave them a gift.[A][ClearBox]When the Dark Dragon awakens again,[Pause=3]
the chosen one of the god will use
his sword to repel darkness.[A][ClearBox][X]
