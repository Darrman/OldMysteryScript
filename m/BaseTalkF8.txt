an interest in the outside world[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] [A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]So I broke the law and took her outside.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] would have done the same.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]However, I lost my dragonstone when we

I'd appreciate it if you didn't group[Pause=3]
this and that together.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What?[Pause=3]
Aren't they the same?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[Music=BGM_EVT_GRAVE1][FaceCommand=0x73]First, you make yer move, and yer
prepared to die[Pause=3] if yer wrong.[A][ClearBox]You only[Pause=3] realize the results later.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So, in yer case[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Do you see now?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]You analyze yer chances of defeat together
with the prince,[Pause=3] and then subtract them
beforehand.[A][ClearBox]The rest is up to the prince.[A]
[FaceCommand=0x73]Am I right?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Well, you[Pause=3] could say that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]So, you see,[Pause=3] gambling is all[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight]I'm not falling for that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]Gah, didn't quite work, huh[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=DICE][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73]Sir Dice.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh,[Pause=3] if it ain't [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]It's rare to see you[Pause=3] calling after me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So, does that [Pause=3]mean you've finally awakened
to the glorious beauty of gambling?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Not quite.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]What[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[EyeCommand=ed]Yer so boring.[A]
Then, what're you here for?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I have a question to ask you.[A][ClearBox]About that item[Pause=3] you used while gambling
with me, Sir Dice[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]If I understand correctly, it was putting
you at a[Pause=3] definite disadvantage.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, that.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Why [Pause=3]would you do such a thing?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No reason.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Then [Pause=3]you wanted to lose on purpose?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Lemme tell yer: when yer gambling,[Pause=3]
the numbers on the dice[Pause=3] don't really matter.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Eh? What do you mean?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_DICE_A_2
[TargetLeft]The important thing is just[Pause=3]
[EyeCommand=eh]whether you can throw the dice or not[Pause=3]
when the time comes.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Life doesn't give you[Pause=3] the chance of using
everything you've piled up[Pause=3] with a bang,
y'know.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]That could[Pause=3] be true.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]By the way,[Pause=3]
I can feel that from[Pause=3] yer prince.[A]
[FaceCommand=0x61]That's why I made a bet.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]For Prince Marth to win.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]But, sadly, all I can bet[Pause=3] is my own body[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=s]I think I get it now.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]However,[Pause=3] it makes me afraid of[Pause=3]
sticking around you for too long[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What's wrong with ya,[Pause=3] talking like I'm a
symbol of misfortune or summit?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Tee hee, I'm sorry.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Alright[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Then, let's have a game to cheer up[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What if I said no?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]Damn, didn't work, huh[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

It's been a while since I last battled,
so my skills have gotten a little rusty.[A][ClearBox]I need to catch up to the others as
soon as I can, while this war rages on.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I heard from Prince Marth that[Pause=3]
you fought in the previous war as a
pegasus knight of Macedonia.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yep, together with[Pause=3] Princess Minerva
and my sisters.
Hee hee, we sure fought a lot[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]When we put in our full effort, there's
no enemy we can't strike down.[Pause=3]
Just wait and see![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Haha, that's most reassuring.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_EST_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EST][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Oh, excellent timing.[Pause=3]
[SpecialText0x14=0x39], could you taste this please?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is this stew[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Miss Est, you can cook too?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]'Course I can,[Pause=3] I'll have you know
I cooked for Abel every day.[A][ClearBox]So, don't be shy and eat it![A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]It's so sweet[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What, really?[Pause=3]
But I cooked it like normal.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]O-oh, I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Excuse me, I need some water.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm, was it too sweet?[Pause=3]
Abel always told me it was delicious[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I suppose it's no problem if you two
appreciate this flavor.[A][ClearBox]This stew might just be a symbol of
your happy life together.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Tee hee, perhaps[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Thanks for the meal.[A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=EST][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And then, Abel and I started
living together after that.[A][ClearBox]I was filled with joy,[Pause=3] since I[Pause=3] loved him dearly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oftentimes I felt a little lonely,
because I couldn't see my sisters[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But Abel was always with me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm envious.[Pause=3]
It sounds like you two lived happily together.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] How should I say this[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Miss Est[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You see, I[Pause=3] brought great suffering to Abel.[A][ClearBox]He was forced to betray Aritia,[Pause=3]
because I was taken hostage[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
He's too nice and doesn't think of himself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Because I was there,[Pause=3] Abel had to go
through such an ordeal[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If not for me, Abel would be happier[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Miss Est[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Don't cry[Pause=3]. You didn't do anything wrong.[A][ClearBox]Please don't keep blaming yourself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Thank you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
You're very good at comforting.[A][ClearBox]Tee hee[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] How embarrassing.[Pause=3]
I feel like a child again.[A][ClearBox]When I was younger, my sisters would rush
to comfort me when I cried.[A][ClearBox][SpecialText0x14=0x39], I feel calmer when I'm with you.
I want to stay with you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]If you believe I'm worthy, you can find me

Sorry, I'll get going right away.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That ring[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Is it dear to you?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Can you tell?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Uh-huh.[Pause=3]
I noticed you staring at it every now
and then.[A][ClearBox]Was it a gift from somebody close to you?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Kind of[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]This is a memento of my late wife.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.[Pause=3]
I'm sorry.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, it's all right.[A][ClearBox]My wife dreamed of a peaceful world,[Pause=3]
and I'm fighting to make her dream
a reality.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But, I suppose I think of her too much.[A][ClearBox][X]

Sorry again.[A][ClearBox]By the way,[Pause=3] do you go around reminding
everyone, everytime?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes. I can't help but wonder how everyone is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're really nice, aren't you?[Pause=3]
Be careful,[Pause=3] the kind ones always die early.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Especially in dangerous times[Pause=3] like these[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Your wife[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
She was kind as well, wasn't she?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, Ursula[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] wanted peace more than
anything.[A][ClearBox]But,[Pause=3] she was too nice.[A][ClearBox]She protected me after I made a mistake,
and lost her life[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's what happened[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
People go to heaven after they die, right?[A][ClearBox]I wonder if Ursula[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
is living there in peace?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I'm certain of it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]In that case[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]If I were to die[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I wonder if I'd see her again[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Etzel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sorry.[Pause=3]
I said something foolish.[Pause=3]
Please forget about it.[A][ClearBox][X]

to talk to you.[A][ClearBox]I know I'm being impertinent, Sir Etzel, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]When I see the way you fight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I can't help but worry.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Worry?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]When you fight, every now and then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It seems like you're searching for a
place to die.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sorry, it's a bad habit of mine.[A][ClearBox]When I'm fighting,[Pause=3]
I can't help but remember her.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Etzel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I don't know anything about Ursula[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Nor do I know how deeply you were
in love with each other[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]However...[Pause=3]
I'm sure Ursula[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] wanted you to live.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]That's why she protected you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ETZEL_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]If you die,[Pause=3] her death will have been in vain.[A][ClearBox]So, please[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] You're right.[A][ClearBox]If I go to where she is after wasting
my life[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]She'll probably be furious.[Pause=3]
"Don't waste a precious life", she'd say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]That's the kind of girl she was[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Etzel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=HORUS][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
I must thank you[Pause=3] for saving my life.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]No, no.[Pause=3]
You should be thanking Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox]He was the one who made the decision
to help you, Lord Horace.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Haha, I see.[Pause=3]
You and Prince Marth are really alike.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Excuse me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Oh, forgive me.[Pause=3]
I found it amusing how the liege and vassal
told me more or less the same thing.[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth told me that too[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
[Pause=3]that I should be thanking you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]R-really?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
You two are really well-matched.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]I'd like to learn from you.[Pause=3]
And to do that, we must first[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, Lord Horace.[Pause=3]
Assuredly, we shall rescue Princess Nina.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's most reassuring to hear it
coming from you, Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]I might not be strong,[Pause=3]
but I'll do my best for Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox]I will be counting on you,[Pause=3] Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Likewise,[Pause=3] Lord Horace.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_HORUS_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=HORUS][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Lord Horace, did you assist Prince Marth
during the War of Darkness as well?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed. However, at first[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Not knowing the situation, I pointed my
spear towards Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox]For that sin,[Pause=3]
I must apologize to you as well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But I heard[Pause=3] you only did that because
the villagers were being held hostage.[A][ClearBox]If you didn't fight Prince Marth,
the enemy would have killed them.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]However, fighting against the League
was the same as opposing your kingdom.[A][ClearBox]You risked being branded a traitor,[Pause=3]
yet you still protected the people.[Pause=3]
I think your conviction was admirable.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm most obliged by your undeserved
understanding.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]The time I've spent with you allowed me 
to learn something.[A][ClearBox]Lord Horace, you are truly an honest man[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And I like that.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh, of course, by that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I meant I think highly of you[Pause=3] as a knight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]'Tis an honor hearing that from you.[Pause=3]

[Pause=3]As a fellow knight, I'm deeply impressed.[A][ClearBox]Not only your performance in battle,[Pause=3]
but also your constant devotion and will
to protect your liege[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Both are very likeable.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Likeable[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. So, could you honor me with your
company?[A][ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_GAG1][TargetRight]M-my company?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes,[Pause=3] I'd like to spar with you.[A][ClearBox]Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3]
you're most definitely a worthy opponent.[Pause=3]
Therefore, I won't need to hold back.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, yes, I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Of course you meant sparring.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You have my thanks, Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][X]

I'll do my best for everyone.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Sir Ymir, you're really kind.[A][ClearBox]I've only spent a short time with you and I
can already tell.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Therefore,[Pause=3] I must apologize again for my
rudeness earlier[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's fine, it's fine.[Pause=3]
I already get what you're feelin'.[Pause=3]
You're really nice.[A][ClearBox]Marth's sure got lots of nice people.[A][ClearBox]I'm relyin' on you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes.[Pause=3]

Let's drop the formalities 'kay?[Pause=3]
We're comrades after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You're right.[Pause=3]
Then, I'll do just that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Awesome,[Pause=3] I like cute girls best when
they're natural.[A][ClearBox]By the way,[Pause=3] have you heard about
the secret shop?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Secret shop?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, my girlfriend Anna runs a
secret shop.[A][ClearBox]It's an amazing shop,[Pause=3] located in the most
secret of spots and with an incredibly
well-camouflaged entrance.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That does sound amazing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]But, even amazing shops like that
have their fair share of problems.[A][ClearBox]Y'see, customers just don't come.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I-I suppose[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]So, we've been thinking of ways to
get more customers to come, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I have one suggestion.[Pause=3]
Can I say it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]Yeah, go ahead.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Why not make it, um, non-secret?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh, but of course[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Wow, you're sharp.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Hmm,[Pause=3] but we can't do that.[Pause=3]
You see, it's a secret shop.[A][ClearBox]If it ain't secret, it wouldn't be a
secret shop anymore now, would it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]That's rather complicated.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah,[Pause=3] don't I know it's troublesome[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_JEIK_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIK][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]You want to know how Anna's secret shop
first started?[A][ClearBox]In the beginning,[Pause=3]
it was a shop of ultra-expensive goods
targetting ultra-wealthy customers.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You mean, royals and nobles?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, people like that.[A][ClearBox]That's why they kick you out unless you
got yourself a special VIP Card.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]VIP Card[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sounds like a very important card.[A][ClearBox]So only nobles have them?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, no.[A][ClearBox]There's only one VIP Card in this world.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]O-only one[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Then I can see why customers don't come[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]In fact, I'd say it's a miracle
that customers come at all[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah.[Pause=3]
It'd be swell if we had more customers[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Well, I have a suggestion[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Can I say it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Sure, 'course you can.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Why not drop the VIP requirement?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Of course[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're really sharp.[A][ClearBox]But, no matter how fetching of a
lass you are, we can't do that.[Pause=3]
It's a secret shop after all[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]That's rather complicated.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah,[Pause=3] don't I know it's troublesome[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_JEIK_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIK][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][TargetRight]Say, Jake.[Pause=3] About the secret shop[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Since its location is meant to be secret,[Pause=3]
you can't tell people exactly where it is.[A][ClearBox]But how about[Pause=3] letting everybody know

I'll give you my special service[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'll tell you where the secret shop is.[A][ClearBox]Then you go tell Prince Marth and the

where I was standing when I met you guys?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, the desert in Anri's Way.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The truth is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
The secret shop was near that very spot[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Now that you know, you'd better tell everyone
right away how to get to the secret shop[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]It's selling really nice goods, y'know[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Jake,[Pause=3] I'm very sorry, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I don't think we're ever going to go

alongside one who is acclaimed as[Pause=3]
the finest archer in the continent.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The finest in the continent[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth]
I'm sorry,[Pause=3] but that's a gross exaggeration.
Please don't mention it again.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh? Why?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I hail from a noble family, you see,[Pause=3]
and somebody within my family just spread
that claim for fame and nothing else.[A][ClearBox]I'm not actually that great.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]A-ah, I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]By the way, may I ask you something?[Pause=3]
At Cashmere Bridge, why were you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Defending the castle, even though
I'm an archer?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Er, yes.[Pause=3]
Well, it was quite fortunate for us, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Truly, bows aren't suited for defending
castles.[Pause=3] If the enemy gets too close, there's
nothing we can do, but pray to God.[A][ClearBox]However, Hardin fully knew that[Pause=3]
when he ordered that guard duty.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]In other words[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right. Basically, an execution.[Pause=3]
He might as well have told me to[Pause=3]
"die defending the castle."[A][ClearBox]
[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_JORJUE_C_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]But why would he[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I kept pointing out the errors of his ways,[Pause=3]
and I didn't support Lang, to boot.[A][ClearBox]From Hardin's viewpoint, I was
nothing but a hindrance.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I thought I should die there, too.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]But [SpecialText0x14=0x39], you and the others[Pause=3]
reminded me of where my loyalty truly lies.[A][ClearBox]For that, I thank you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]The pleasure is mine and I am thankful to
be able to fight alongside you, Sir George.[A][ClearBox][X]

lovers that day.[A][ClearBox]The members of my family who wanted
me and Midia to wed were livid, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]'Twas a matter of feelings, you see.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I had no idea[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]And that's why I'm still single.[Pause=3]
If only I could find a nice girl who
would comfort me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I knew you'd say that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I've heard the rumors.[A][ClearBox]At this rate, people are going to start
thinking you're a shallow man.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Haha, wouldn't that be troublesome?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]But, that's exactly the impression you want
to give others[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Am I right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hm?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Those who lay eyes on you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Are captivated by your beauty and your
rank of nobility.[A][ClearBox]But your fighting style[Pause=3] seems at odds with
your appearance. If anything, it seems
somewhat calculated.[A][ClearBox]My grandfather once taught me[Pause=3]
one's way of fighting reveals more about
them than anything else.[A][ClearBox]Aren't you[Pause=3] actually a very ingenious man?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Am I?[Pause=3]
Why would you think that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Back in Cashmere Bridge,[Pause=3]
when we persuaded you to our side[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Didn't that go exactly as you planned?[A][ClearBox]You were ordered by Hardin to defend
the castle,[Pause=3] but you could have hid and
instead chose to remain in plain sight.[A][ClearBox]You knew[Pause=3] a lone archer in that position
wouldn't pose a threat to our army.[A][ClearBox]And besides, you had a deep relationship
with Aritia,[Pause=3] having taught Gordon in the
ways of archery[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]
[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_JORJUE_B_2
[TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You think too highly of me.
I am not that smart.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]And if we go even further back[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
You refusing to support Lang back in Grunia
might have been a preparation for that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]As long as your subordinates were with you,
you couldn't switch to Prince Marth's side,[Pause=3]
but you didn't want to fight him either[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]In order to make the Aritian army aware
of your intentions, you chose not to make
a move[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And that action led us to convince you back
in Cashmere Bridge.[A][ClearBox]Not to mention it enraged Emperor Hardin,
causing you to defend the castle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]If all of this was premeditated[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
you are truly a fearsome man.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You overestimate me.
It all happened by chance.[A][ClearBox]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Even if I could see that far ahead[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Such a plan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] wouldn't have worked
without the co-operation of Aritia's army.[A][ClearBox]It was only successful because I
believed you would act wisely.[A][ClearBox][X]

encourage me to become stronger.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Alright.[Pause=3]

It's rare to see you around here.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Your willpower and vitality are admirable.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Not at all.
It's all thanks to continuous training.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Besides, you can easily handle this
amount of training as well, right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The training I can handle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
But weren't you checking around the

Are all Royal Guards jacks-of-all-trades?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Y-you have good sources.[Pause=3]
Naturally my duty as a Royal Guard
comes first.[A][ClearBox]But I think it's equally important to
forge bonds with my comrades.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]And why is that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]That's because I believe trust

You won't be young forever, after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hey[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] How could you say that to a girl?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Listen to me.[Pause=3]
One can grow by relying on others too.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You have the stamina, so you afford to
check on other units. You can also cook
and clean.[Pause=3] That isn't bad at all.[A][ClearBox]But you can't do every single thing
even if you're the only one who can.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You might have a point.[A][ClearBox]But when I think about it, it's hard to
ask others when I could just do it myself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That might be true for you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Looking at you, I'm reminded of how I
used to be.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]How you used to be?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, once, I couldn't rest until I had
done everything myself, just like you.[A][ClearBox]However, there's a limit to what one

I knocked on the gate of Aritia Castle
because I wanted to serve Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So you've chosen your liege yourself.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes. I'm extremely fortunate to be able
to serve Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I can understand that.
You see, I didn't have the opportunity of
choosing my own liege.[A][ClearBox]But I am proud of having served under

then I'm sure he was a great man.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed, he was.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]If something were to befall Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I'm certain you'd feel just like we did,

I just couldn't believe it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Indeed,[Pause=3] I can't believe our

Wind Mage don't they, Sir Marich?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. I suppose I acquired that name
because of my mastery of Excalibur.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see. The wind magic, Excalibur[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Excalibur suits you well, Sir Marich.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I guess[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] But,[Pause=3] would you be surprised
if I said I didn't choose Excalibur,[Pause=3]
but rather Excalibur chose me?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Excalibur[Pause=3] chose you?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MARICH_B_2
[TargetLeft]That's right.[Pause=3]
Our teacher, Master Wendel, once gave[Pause=3]
Excalibur to me and Thoron to Ellerean.[A][ClearBox]I didn't receive Excalibur because
I was better[Pause=3] than Ellerean.[A][ClearBox]But, rather, it was because of the
magic's personality.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Magic has personality?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]While very rare,[Pause=3] some magic tomes have a
"will" of their own[Pause=3] and the magic itself
chooses its owner.[A][ClearBox]Excalibur is one such tome.[Pause=3]
I guess Excalibur liked my personality[Pause=3]
since it chose me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Magic choosing its user[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth]
Now I've seen everything.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Haha. So, as you can see, I only
became the Wind Mage by chance.[A][ClearBox]If things had gone a little differently,[Pause=3]
then perhaps Ellerean would be the one
being called the Wind Mage.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[FaceCommand=0x73]However, I must say, wind magic
really suits you, Sir Marich.[A][ClearBox]Excalibur was probably smitten by
your calm disposition.[A][ClearBox]Truly, no wind magic could resist
your charms, Sir Marich.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, that's kind of you.[Pause=3]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARICH][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Marich, what are your plans[Pause=3]
once this war is over?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm, I haven't decided yet.[Pause=3]
Once peace comes,[Pause=3] there are a lot of
things I'd like to do.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]But, they'd all have to wait until 
after I rescue Princess Ellis.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Princess Ellis[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, I couldn't protect her during the
War of Darkness[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
and failed to protect her this time too.[A][ClearBox]That's my greatest regret[Pause=3]
for having left Aritia.[A][ClearBox]This time, I'll definitely stay by
her side and protect her.[A][ClearBox]It was for that reason[SpecialSymbol=0x96]and that
reason alone[SpecialSymbol=0x96]that I honed my magic.[A][ClearBox]For the one[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I really wish to protect[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
For Princess Ellis.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So you love the princess that much[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'll do my best, Sir Marich.[Pause=3]
Let's rescue the princess as soon as we can.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You have my thanks[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MIDIA_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MIDIA][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Miss Midia.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're that Aritian knight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, my name is [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]I thought to greet you, as a fellow
comrade[Pause=3] fighting under Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Likewise,[Pause=3] nice to meet you.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]We need to defeat the villain who was
manipulating Emperor Hardin
from the shadows.[A][ClearBox]For the sake of Akaneia[Pause=3]
and for this world[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Yes.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]By the way,[Pause=3]
you're a female knight just like me.[A][ClearBox]Being a knight when you're female[Pause=3]
brings all sorts of inconveniences,
don't you think?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Quite indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's complicated even to find a refuge
to sleep during the campaigns.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I understand, I felt the same.[A][ClearBox]I hope we'll get along well,[Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you,[Pause=3] Miss Midia.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MIDIA_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MIDIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]I wonder[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] what caused Emperor Hardin
to change so much?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I believe Bishop Boa[Pause=3] explained the reason
for Hardin's insanity clear enough.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]He felt great suffering, knowing that
he had no place in Princess Nina's heart[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Garnef grasped onto that chance[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetRight]However, I just don't understand[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I only knew Emperor Hardin after
he changed.[A][ClearBox]But according to Prince Marth,[Pause=3]
he used to be an outstanding man[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Quite. Emperor Hardin was[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
a man of outstanding character,[Pause=3]
and an excellent statesman.[A][ClearBox]I, too, approved of him[Pause=3]
becoming emperor.[A][ClearBox]I believed he'd be able to make
Akaneia a good country.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But can somebody[Pause=3]
really change that much?[A][ClearBox]He completely neglected his duties[Pause=3]
as the Emperor, just because he couldn't
possess Princess Nina's love[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't you understand?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MIDIA_B_2
[TargetRight]No, I'm afraid don't.[Pause=3]
Of course,[Pause=3]
I believe it must have been hard for him.[A][ClearBox]However,[Pause=3]
if he's the Emperor,[Pause=3] he's needed.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed, the crimes he has committed
cannot be forgiven.[A][ClearBox]And if you think about it, the gap in
his heart might have invited all this.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I feel like I understand him a little.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Miss Midia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]The stronger your love is towards someone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]The harder it is to bear the loss
of that love[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]As a knight, I wholly condemn Hardin,
but[Pause=3] I can understand[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] the pain he felt.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MIDIA_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MIDIA][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Say, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Do you have[Pause=3] someone special in your heart?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?[Pause=3]
Yes, of course. Prince Marth is my liege
and I'll serve him for my entire life[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Not that, I meant a lover.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]A l-lover?[Pause=3]
No, I don't[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Isn't there anybody you like?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm no good with that sort of thing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see.[Pause=3]
So, as a senior knight, let me give you
a piece of advice.[A][ClearBox]We're knights, but we're women too.[Pause=3]
So, isn't it good for us to love somebody?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I wonder.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Do you know what I think?[Pause=3]
If you were really to fall in love
with someone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I believe you'd become a far
more charming individual.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-I'll do my best.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]And I hope you'll find happiness in love.[A][ClearBox]Don't be deceived by a bad man.
I want you to be happy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_MISHEIL_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MISHEIL][EyeCommand=ec][LoadBackground=BBG75][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER]Prince Misheil?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][SpecialText0x14=0x39], was it?[A]
I've heard about your exploits.[A][ClearBox]Damn that Prince Marth,[Pause=3]
he's got a sharp eye for talent.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'll treat those words[Pause=3]
as a compliment to Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Go ahead.[A][ClearBox]I'm planning to leave this land[Pause=3]
once I save Maria.[A]
There's no point in him knowing.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Leave[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] this land?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's correct.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]In that case[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]  what will you tell
Princess Maria?[Pause=3]
Isn't she waiting for you?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'll save her,[Pause=3]
but I won't say a word afterwards.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Th-that's horrible[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]The only one who should talk to
Maria now[Pause=3] is her sister, Minerva.[A][ClearBox]I don't have the[Pause=3] right anymore.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]And why is that?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I don't have[Pause=3] any ties with Macedonia anymore.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So you're running.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]What did you say?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_MISHEIL_C_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]I heard you were[Pause=3] once reunited with
Princess Minerva on the battlefield.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You speak of during the War of Darkness.[A][ClearBox]So,[Pause=3] what of it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] didn't the princess[Pause=3]
ask you to[Pause=3] mend your ways?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Bah.[A][ClearBox]Why do you[Pause=3] know that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No,[Pause=3] I didn't know.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]But, considering her personality,[Pause=3]
I just[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] presumed[Pause=3] she would have.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Gah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]Not because you committed a mistake,[Pause=3]
or for abandoning your kingdom[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]I believe[Pause=3] the princess's true wish was for
you[Pause=3] to abandon your lance and walk
a new path.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hmph.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]You're[Pause=3] a woman who doesn't fear a king.[A][EyeCommand=ec][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]I'm flattered.[EyeCommand=ed][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]If I had someone like you by my side,[Pause=3]
just like Prince Marth does now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]No, I had one in the past.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=eh]There was once a[Pause=3] fearless woman standing
by my side, too.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Prince Misheil.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A]
[FaceCommand=0x73]No, Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]

MBTK_ROBERTO_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROBERTO][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Robert, there's hay on your back[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Were you in the stable again?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Again, you say[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth]
So my secret's been exposed.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I've seen you there rather frequently.
You seem to be well accustomed to dealing
with horses.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It's nothing special.
I know a bit because I ride them, that's all.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm a Grunian knight, but I hail from
a slightly bizarre family. I've been riding
horses a lot ever since I was a kid.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah, that explains it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Explains what?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, no[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] The groom was mighty impressed.[A][ClearBox]He said that you must really like horses
to speak to them.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That fellow talks too much.[A][ClearBox]There's a foal over there right now.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, is that so?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I think he'll let you see him if you ask.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ROBERTO_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROBERTO][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Robert, you're extremely familiar
with horses and I was just curious[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Can you understand what they say?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's an odd question.[Pause=3]
Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Well, I can tell what they want
and what they don't. That's about it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Disappointed?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Not at all[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I asked because, before, I heard
there are people in this world who can
understand what ponies say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Really? Sounds like a lie to me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But it'd be wonderful if it were true.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Indeed.[Pause=3]
But, well, if I could communicate with
them, I'd probably have to apologize.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]For what?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]For getting them involved in a war.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'd do the same.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ROBERTO_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROBERTO][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]You really put your effort into everything[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, since I'm one of Prince Marth's Royal
Guards after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Are all Royal Guards jacks-of-all-trades?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Why does it feel like I've heard that line
from someone else already[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oh, that foal has been growing fast, hasn't
he?[Pause=3] He puts a smile on my face.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Haha, indeed.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Robert, you reminded me of something
very important.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hm?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Peace is the best recourse.[Pause=3]
Of course, I already knew that was
Prince Marth's desire, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Until now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I believe I've been way too obsessed with
obtaining more strength to battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So, after meeting the weaponless horses,
you've started to think that peace[SpecialSymbol=0x96]and
not violence[SpecialSymbol=0x96]is best?[Pause=3][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see you've had a change of heart.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, a little[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It batters your heart to see one of them
hurt, doesn't it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, that's right.[Pause=3]
I saw a really injured horse this morning[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Sir Robert, are you skilled in treating horses?[Pause=3]
Shall we check it together?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see you've taken up yet another job
already[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Sure, let's go take a look.[A][ClearBox][X]

[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Oh, it's you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]Don't shout so suddenly.[Pause=3]
You gave me one heck of a fright.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Actually, I called you many times[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]So you desire to date someone, Sir Roger?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Huh? W-were you listening?[Pause=3]
Oh boy.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Well, what's done is done.[Pause=3]
Since you know everything already,
can I ask you something?[A][ClearBox]Could you, um, give me some advice[Pause=3]
so I can score myself a date?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]To be honest, I've no confidence.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]But, I won't know until I've tried,[Pause=3]
so I'll give it my best shot.[A][ClearBox]What kind of girl do you like, Sir Roger?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ROJAR_C_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Eh?[Pause=3]
Now that you ask me,[Pause=3]
I don't think I have a preference[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Well, I'm not exactly pretty myself,[Pause=3]
so I don't really have high standards.[A][ClearBox]I guess anyone[Pause=3] in this army would do.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Anyone[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Eh?[Pause=3]
Did I say anything wrong?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Roger[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] "Anyone" just doesn't cut it.[A][ClearBox]No girl wants to to hear that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I-is that so?[Pause=3]
I had no idea[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Well, it makes sense, I suppose.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Alright, I'll make an effort and think
harder about my tastes;[Pause=3]
I'm counting on you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROJAR][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] listen to me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Roger?[Pause=3] What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]After our last talk,[Pause=3] I thought real hard[Pause=3]
about the ideal type of woman for me.[A][ClearBox]Well, she should have a beautiful face[Pause=3]
and an adorable smile.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Got it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]A large chest would be swell, too.[Pause=3]
But I'd prefer thin hips[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]She should be wealthy, gentle, reliable,
sweet[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]a good cook, talker, listener, have a
nice voice and be able to hold her liquor[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]She must be somebody who's always
loved me,[Pause=3] secretly thinking of me till
this day, longing for me every night[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Somebody who's been a little sister to

wishes to be seen as a mature woman[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.[Pause=3]
I think I got it,[Pause=3] Sir Roger.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Oh, but there's more[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

How about you introduce me to
another girl, then?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]O-oh, right.[Pause=3]
I, uh, don't really have anyone in mind[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Though[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] there might be someone out there
waiting for you, you know?
Like a secret admirer.[A][ClearBox]I guess you can't entirely rule out that
possibility.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I suppose not.[A][ClearBox]So, she's shy, eh?[Pause=3]
I had no idea.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What if you took the initiative, Sir Roger?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're right,[Pause=3]
I should seize the day and ask her myself[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Thanks, [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'll give it a shot[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I hope this isn't the start of something terrifying.[A][ClearBox][X]

many people would be able to do.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]I wanted to repay a favor[Pause=3] to Coyote[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]The four of us[Pause=3] didn't have parents,

Coyote raised us.[A][ClearBox]That's why[Pause=3] I wanted to follow in
Coyote's footsteps[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I find it most admirable.[Pause=3]
I'm very impressed by your dedication.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]But, I'm just[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] a hypocrite[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]All I'm doing is killing more people
during this war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm weak.[Pause=3]
I'm doing all this just to try and
flee from that sin[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]The townsfolk told me the same.[Pause=3]
That I'm just a hypocrite[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ROSHE_B_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sir Roshe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]I don't think you're a bad hypocrite.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Pardon?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]There are probably people who call your
actions hypocrisy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]However, in truth, you're the person
who's saving those kids' lives.
Am I not right?[A][ClearBox]If you can save somebody through hypocrisy,[Pause=3]
that doesn't automatically make you a bad
person, just because you're a hypocrite.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]In fact, I'd say that hypocrite is a
better person than those who accuse him[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=3]
The ones who do nothing to help.[A][ClearBox]That's what I think.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]T-thanks.[Pause=3]
This is the first time somebody has
put it that way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

there will be no more war orphans.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, that's right.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]The lives lost in this war won't come back[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
So, at least this glimmer of hope remains[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Sir Roshe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Fighting Emperor Hardin was probably[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
harshest to you, of all people.[A][ClearBox]Since you are kinder than most,[Pause=3]
you're hurt more than most, too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I'm just weak.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]If kindness is weakness[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Then there's no reason to become strong.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]However, I like your kindness, Sir Roshe.[Pause=3]
Please don't[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] abandon it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you[FreezeMouth]... [UnfreezeMouth][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][X]

and take a well-earned rest.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIMA][TargetRight]Oh, Princess Sheema.[A][ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_DAILY1][TargetLeft]You are[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]You have my thanks for saving the[Pause=3]
people of Gra in the previous battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I'm flattered.[A][ClearBox]However, the one who gave us the orders[Pause=3]
was Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed.[A][ClearBox]I think I shall[Pause=3] thank Prince Marth
again later.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]By the way,[Pause=3] Princess.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]W-what is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]This is the lounge, so[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
wouldn't it be better to be rid of
your armor?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Meh,[Pause=3] you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] you're not wrong.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Then,[Pause=1] let me help you.[Pause=3]
It looks very heavy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I'm fine[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Erm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]What's wrong?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sorry[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I've remembered some urgent matters
that require my immediate attention.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Excuse me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]Ah, [Pause=1]Princess![Pause=3]
Something fell from your armor[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oh, she's already left.[Pause=3]
Well, this is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]a doll?[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SIMA_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIMA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Tsk, I can't find it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]If anybody gets wind of this, I'll[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Ah, Princess Sheema[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Gah, Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What are you doing here[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]What[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] am I doing here?[Pause=3]
This is the lounge.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]A-ah, right.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, that reminds me.[Pause=3]
Princess.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]I believe you dropped this.[Pause=3]
It's such a cute doll.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]AHH[FreezeMouth]!!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Why,[Pause=3] why is it with you[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]You dropped it when we talked earlier.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Ohh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
My greatest blunder[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?[Pause=3]
You're[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] exaggerating.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]You must be disappointed, no?[A][ClearBox]That the princess of a kingdom would[Pause=3]
possess such a hobby[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Well,[Pause=1] I'm a little surprised perhaps,[Pause=3]
but not disappointed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]This[Pause=3] is a memento of my late mother.[A][ClearBox]Since I'm faint of heart,[Pause=3]
I secretly carry this inside my armor[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
It's highly unbecoming of a princess.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I see.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] if the people were to know this,[Pause=3]
I'd never be able to show my face as
the princess of Gra again.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Fare thee well, Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Please forget about me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]What, wait[Pause=3] Princess[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIMA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]Princess Sheema[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Please wait[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What is it,[Pause=3] Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox]If you wish to ridicule me,
I'll accept it gracefully.[A][ClearBox]"Sheema the Doll Princess."
I could[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] live with that.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I have no such intention.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]In fact, [Pause=1]I feel like I understand you
better now, Princess.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You're kind, Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
However, there is no point in pitying me.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I'm not pitying you.[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Please listen to me.[A][ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_GRAVE1][Pause=3]I took a good look at Gra's soldiers,
in the previous battle.[A][ClearBox]They were all novices,[Pause=3]
clearly lacking in combat ability.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]However, they didn't retreat.[Pause=3]
Do you know why?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Because they loved[Pause=3]
Gra, their country[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes.[A][ClearBox]As well as the princess they supported
enthusiastically[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]In other words, you,[Pause=3] Princess.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]You think your people would be
disappointed by your memento?[A]
Aren't you being unfair to them?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SIMA_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]You[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] you're right.[A][ClearBox]It seems I was foolish.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I thank you for helping me realize that.[A]
It's all thanks to you, Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]No, not at all.[A]
I just[Pause=1] put my feelings into words.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I see.[Pause=3]
I'm a little envious.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Oh, yes. One more thing.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I like cute things, too.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

and Prince Marth's Royal Guard.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Never heard of you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'd be surprised if you had.[Pause=3]
I'm still unworthy, after all.[A][ClearBox]I've heard the rumors from Sir Jeigan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sir Wolf, captain of the Wolfguard[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A][ClearBox]The strongest and most famous of the
Orleanian knights, serving directly under
His Majesty, Emperor Hardin[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And in the last war you, their leader,[Pause=3]
displayed an overwhelming strength,
befitting of your position.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I have no intention of being surpassed in
battle[Pause=3], and not by you puny Aritian knights.[A][ClearBox]Besides[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] don't misunderstand.[Pause=3]
The Wolfguard's strength is not mine alone.[A][ClearBox]It also belongs to Zagaro,
my assistant in the battlefield.[Pause=3]
As well as Biraku and Roshe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]And more than anything,[Pause=3]
it belongs to Coyote[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Because he was with us.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Emperor Hardin, huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Hmm, I'm not sure what to say[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Forget it.[Pause=3]
Coyote's thoughts and intentions are clear
to us.[A][ClearBox]I'll smite the villain who led him astray.
That is all.[A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=WOLF][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]You're[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] [SpecialText0x14=0x39], was it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Wolf?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I apologize for my rudeness the other day.[A][ClearBox]It seems I have made light of your strength.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Huh?[Pause=3]
Y-you don't need to lower your head
like that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I pay respect to the strong.[A][ClearBox]I realized the moment I saw you fight.[Pause=3]
You're strong.[Pause=3]
You may even have more potential than me.[A][ClearBox]And that strength[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
isn't something you can easily acquire.[Pause=3]
It's something obtained from sweat and pain.[A][ClearBox]Just like mine[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
It's a strength continuously tempered from a
very early age, for the sake of your liege.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I have trained since my childhood,
so I could serve as a knight of Aritia.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]To think there was a knight like you
in Aritia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]However, I don't understand.[Pause=3]
Is Prince Marth really[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
a liege you'd risk your life for?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Absolutely.[Pause=3]
Serving him is my joy.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then I must say this:[Pause=3]
He's not a liege befitting of you.[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth rebelled against Akaneia,
seizing the land and ruling it through
strength and fear[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]His ultimate aim to take over the world,
eventually[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That is what I've been told.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_WOLF_B_2
[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]That's utter nonsense[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]If you knew Prince Marth, Sir Wolf,[Pause=3]
you'd realize how ridiculous you sounded.[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth isn't like that all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]I spoke rudely,[Pause=3] forgive me.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Were somebody to insult my liege,
I would not forgive them myself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I understand that feeling all too well.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The people loathe Coyote, as if he
were a demon.[A][ClearBox]But what they say matters not to us,[Pause=3]
because we know his true kindness.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]However, you're different[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I want you to understand the true Coyote.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Coyote is absolutely not a bad person.[Pause=3]
In reality, he's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Wolf[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]How about we discuss[Pause=3] our respective lieges?[A][ClearBox]I don't know Emperor Hardin.[Pause=3]
Meanwhile, you seem to have a twisted image
of Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox]If we talk to each other,[Pause=3] I'm sure we'll be
able to better understand one other.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_WOLF_A

Soon, the world will see peaceful days again[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, that's right.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]How ironic.[Pause=3]
I wished to die for my liege[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]And yet I continue to live,[Pause=3]
and will soon return to my motherland[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Sir Wolf[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]What kind of place is your motherland,

with flowers of all colors[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
and a cool breeze blowing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]A beautiful country, I'm sure[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah. [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I want to show you the Lea of Orleans
someday.[A][ClearBox]I want you to see the land we loved[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
the land Coyote loved.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
