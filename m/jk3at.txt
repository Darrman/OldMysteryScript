[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICH][LoadBackground=BBG76][TargetRight]So here we are[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I can feel an ominous presence inside.[A][ClearBox]Ellerean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN]Hmph.[Pause=3]
You didn't even need to mention it.[Pause=3]
I already noticed it long ago.[A][ClearBox]However, what is the meaning of this?
Didn't Garnef die in the previous war?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]True. But according to Master Wendel,[Pause=3]
Garnef's subordinates[SpecialSymbol=0x96]the heretic bishops[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
are on the prowl.[A][ClearBox]
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RINDA]Garnef[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Even after his death, he still tries to bring
disaster to this world.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Linda[FreezeMouth]... [UnfreezeMouth]Are you fine with coming here?[Pause=3]
It's dangerous inside.[Pause=3] Maybe you'd better
return to Princess Nina[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]We've already talked over this.
I'm an experienced mage just like you.[A][ClearBox]And besides[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
We're friends, right?[Pause=3]
And friends always help each other.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Alright. [Pause=3]
Then I'll borrow your strength.[Pause=3]
Thank you, Linda.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ETZEL]This is most unusual though.
An all-mage party[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Will we be alright?[A][ClearBox]I'm lending you my strength because I owe
Khadein, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] this is going to be a difficult
battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]You speak truly, Sir Etzel.[A][ClearBox]None of us can withstand many enemy
attacks.[Pause=3] We must proceed with caution.[A][ClearBox][X]

I have no time to waste with you.[A][ClearBox]I have to go and save my sister.
Dig yourself a hole and hide or whatever
takes your fancy.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]W-wait, you don't have to be so mean![A][ClearBox]Well, I'm grateful because you saved me
when those barbarians tried to kidnap me.[A][ClearBox]But, how am I supposed to get back to town
if you just leave me here?[A][ClearBox]You're a man, so you have to take
responsibility until the very end.[Pause=3]
If you do, then I'll[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]Ah, wait, waaait[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Don't leave me behind[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Meanie. I bet you've got a terrible
relationship with your sister![A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MISHEIL][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] bull's eye?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]As if.[Pause=3]
More like you missed the mark completely.[A][ClearBox]But, what gave you the idea?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, that's easy.
You may be pretty handsome, but you don't
understand a girl's heart at all.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]Understand?
You know, girls are[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

These foes are hardly a match for me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]That's Ellerean for you.[Pause=3]
This is your first real battle, yet you're as
cool as a cucumber. I'm amazed.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Naturally.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft]As if I would falter and commit a mistake in
front of you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICH][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh?
Did you say something?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]No, I did not.[Pause=3]

If you aren't our enemy, then I wonder if
you could help us?[A][ClearBox]If we could fight together[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I refuse.[Pause=3]
I'm not like Prince Marth.[Pause=3]
I don't intend to rely on others.[A][ClearBox]But, indeed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If you don't get in my way, then I suppose I

[Fade=40][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICH][LoadBackground=BBG11][TargetRight][TargetRight]Ellerean, it seems we've vanquished all the
enemies in the ruins.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Marich, look.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hmm?
This magic circle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Apparently, the heretic bishops were
planning to hold some sort of ritual here.[A][ClearBox]Not only that, but this is Garnef's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
forbidden magic[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Bah.
Is that all you've noticed?[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Look at this offering and the pattern of the
circle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'm sure Master Wendel has taught
you what they mean.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
I see. This is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Dark magic to raise a dead body back to
life[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Were the heretic bishops trying to resurrect
Garnef's body[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What fools.[Pause=3]
There's no point in resurrecting the body if
the soul is no longer here.[A][ClearBox]Although, had they suceeded in this ritual,
they might have given birth to a monster
taking Garnef's appearance[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed.[Pause=3]
But it seems we managed to avoid that.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]That's because we worked together.[Pause=3]
You too, Ellerean.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hmph. Don't misunderstand.[Pause=3]
I didn't fight for your sakes or anything.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I still want to thank you.[Pause=3]
Because you're helping me.
Right now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Bah[Pause=3]
You've always been a nutter.[A][ClearBox]But ever since the War of Darkness ended[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You've been acting nuttier than usual.[Pause=3]
Is it because of Prince Marth?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You're correct.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Ever since I was a child[FreezeMouth]... [UnfreezeMouth]
I wanted to protect those precious to me.[A][ClearBox]I studied hard, here in Khadein, because I
really desired that power.[A][ClearBox]However, being together with Prince Marth,
and fighting that war by his side[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I learned something.[A][ClearBox]That the key to success, more than pursuing
power alone[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] is to join forces with your
comrades.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Ellerean, you always rejected me when I asked
you to be my friend[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But, I hope we'll be able to fight side-by-side
again, like we did this time.[A][ClearBox]If we join forces, even Garnef would be no
match for us.[Pause=3] That's what I believe.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Marich[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hmph.
I'll think about it.[A][ClearBox]There might still be enemies hiding.
