[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=OGUMA][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=YUMINA][LoadBackground=BBG16][TargetLeft]Yumina, Yubello.[A][ClearBox]This place is notorious for the Macedonian
Vikings.[A][ClearBox]If we could, we'd stay the hell away,
but the village where Lord Wendel resides
is just past this area.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=YUBELLO]Mister Oguma[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm scared[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Can we go back[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=YUMINA]Yubello[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] Get a hold of yourself!
You're a man, are you not[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth]
Show some spine![A][ClearBox]You can use a Fire tome, can't you?
So... fight with it[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But Master Wendel said that we mustn't
fight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Besides, I don't like fighting.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ugh, stop complaining!
It's just you and me now.[A][ClearBox]You have to stay strong, because I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] sniff[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I don't know what we're supposed to do[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'm sorry, Yumina[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=OGUMA][LoadBackground=][TargetRight]And just who the hell are you[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Do you know them?[A][ClearBox]
[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MS004_TK1_01
[TargetLeft]No, I don't...[Pause=3]
But I do know that, as things stand,
you won't escape with them.[A][ClearBox]As I understand it, the Aritian army should
arrive here, provided you reach the
southern village.[A][ClearBox]Please, allow me to distract the bandits,
while you make your escape to safety.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see. The Aritian army?
So Prince Marth is here, eh?[Pause=3]
Got it, thanks.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]I've got to ask though. 
Why help a group of complete strangers like
us?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I want to save the children.[Pause=3]
That is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] all.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Sirius[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] You said your name was Sirius, right?[Pause=3]
Let's meet again after we both get out of
here![A][ClearBox]There's someone I need to take care of...
The guy in charge of Grunia's occupation,
Commander Lang.[A][ClearBox]I want to avenge a man named Lawrence[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]You[SpecialSymbol=0x96]join me[FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If I've got you on my side, then I'll be that
much stronger.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That would be interesting.[A][ClearBox]But first, you have to survive.[Pause=3]

[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=KASHIM][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG26][TargetRight]Well, if it isn't Kashim![Pause=3]
What brings you to a place like this?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ah, Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Erm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Actually, I need money for medicine for me
sick mother.[A][ClearBox]But I couldn't find any work in Talis,
so I moved here instead.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] That's terrible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I do hope your mother gets better.[A][ClearBox]Well, goodbye then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth].........[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Wait[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

You've done so much for me.[A][ClearBox]I want to help you.[Pause=3]
Please, let me fight alongside you.[A][ClearBox]You have me life at your disposal[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MS004_VIL2
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=UNCLE][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG26][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, you're[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] you're[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] the prince of Aritia![Pause=3]
How nice of you to drop by, sir![A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I heard Lord Wendel was living here.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, that, er[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] was correct[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Yesterday, a group of Akaneian soldiers
suddenly came and took the pontifex away.[A][ClearBox]Although, Prince...[Pause=3]
He did leave this magic tome behind.[A][ClearBox]I believe it's wind magic.[Pause=3]
Please, take it with you.[A][ClearBox][X]

MS004_BT_GAIL
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=GAIL][LoadBackground=]I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

I'll be smashing your pretty head in[FreezeMouth]!!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SHEEDA][LoadBackground=BBG40][TargetLeft]Marth[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sheeda[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth]
Did something happen to Aritia?[Pause=3]
Why are you here[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Aritia...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Aritia was attacked by the imperial
army.[A][ClearBox]The Akaneian League... Gra and Orleans
ambushed us.[Pause=3] Our forces were annihilated
and we lost the castle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wh-what did you say[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
This can't be happening![Pause=3]
Aritia is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Jeigan, what's going on?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN]This is terrible beyond words[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That which I feared the most has come to
pass.[A][ClearBox]Emperor Hardin likely heard Lang's story, 
and had us branded traitors.[A][ClearBox]Your highness, please forgive me.
It is my fault that this has happened.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I refuse to believe it.[Pause=3]
Hardin would never attack Aritia![A][ClearBox]You're telling me that he believed Lang and
truly thought that I wished to instigate a
rebellion? [Pause=3]Never![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I agree with you, sire.[Pause=3]
This attack was too soon.
It happened far too quickly.[A][ClearBox]For an attack of this scale, a great number
of preparations had to have been in place.[A][ClearBox]It is likely[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] that the Grunia campaign was a
setup. As was the situation in Macedonia.[A][ClearBox]It's quite simple, really.
They had you leave Aritia, with your elite
knights in tow,[A][ClearBox]and then proceeded to attack our weakened
defenses.[A][ClearBox]Hardin had this planned right from the start.
What happened with Lang was just an
excuse to attack our country.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's preposterous[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Are you implying that Hardin[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
with no provocation whatsoever[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
decided to attack his fellow nation[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Are you seriously suggesting this was all an
elaborate trap[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]No!
I won't accept it...[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN]Your highness, regardless, our country has
been attacked by Akaneia. Not only that,
but we were ambushed without prior warning.[A][ClearBox]That, to us knights, is the most
dishonourable action one could take.
In that case, we have no choice but to fight[A][ClearBox]back with our full strength.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hardin[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] why?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SHEEDA][TargetLeft]Princess Sheeda, what of the others?[Pause=3]
Is Princess Ellis safe?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Ellis, she[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
She gave herself up in order to let me
escape with this message.[A][ClearBox]The others... I don't know...
Abel and Est were still fighting the
last time I saw them...[A][ClearBox]Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'm so sorry.[Pause=3] I'm the only one
who escaped... Ellis wanted me to warn you,
no matter what[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sniff[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARS][FaceCommand=0x73]Sheeda[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Don't cry. I understand.[Pause=3]
Just knowing you're safe makes me happy.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]I should be the one apologizing.[Pause=3]
I shouldn't have left[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] 
You needn't have to go through this.[A][ClearBox]We will take back Aritia.[A][ClearBox]Even if we have to fight Hardin, we WILL
reclaim our homeland![A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]

[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MS004_ED2_A
[TargetRight]Yeah.[Pause=3] I'll have to apologize to Father Riff
later, but I think I'll change it back to normal.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
I do believe that would be a good idea.[A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]

MS004_ED2_B
[TargetRight]No, it's alright.[Pause=3]
I'm quite fond of my new hair...
Or lack of it, rather.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I-is that so?[Pause=3]
Well, if that's your wish, then I can hardly
complain.[A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]
