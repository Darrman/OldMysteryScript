So the Aritians have come.[A][ClearBox]Reinforcements are arriving soon;[Pause=3]
if we can hold out a little longer,
we can make a pincer attack.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=NABARL][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Swordsman Navarre.[Pause=3]
When they open that door, you make your
move.[A][ClearBox]There is no need for restraint;[Pause=3]
slice them to pieces[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Sure.[Pause=3]
Though the knights of Aritia are hardly
worthy enemies.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh-ho[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] That's my Navarre.[Pause=3]
They say not even Oguma of Talis is your
equal.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What? Oguma[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
N[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Naturally[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
A guy like him is no match for me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see.[Pause=3] Glad to hear it.[Pause=3]

[LoadBackground=MARS][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft]Sire, there seems to be movement near
the front of the castle.[Pause=3] And it would
appear to be moving towards our forces.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Are they enemy reinforcements?[Pause=3]
Or allies to our cause[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I do not know, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Thank goodness you're safe.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You too, sire.
Norne and I escaped from Aritia Castle
and we rode here as fast as we could.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=NORN]But the rest of our forces were scattered[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm sorry we couldn't all make it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You don't have to apologize,
I'm just glad that you're safe.[Pause=3]
The others can take care of themselves.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=FREY]Sire.[Pause=3]
From here on we shall accompany you.[Pause=3]
Please give us your orders.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=NORN]Oh, and please be careful[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I caught a glimpse of enemy troops
approachin' the castle behind us.[A][ClearBox]I expect they'll be enterin' the castle soon.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Enemy reinforcements?[Pause=3]

That's just too cruel![A][ClearBox]Did our love really mean that little to you?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Can it,[Pause=3] you little fink[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
People'll get the wrong idea about us,[Pause=3]

I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as
Samto.[A][ClearBox]Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this
famous "Navarre" swordsman guy.[A][ClearBox]I got tired of it after a while, so I decided
to pose as him and got myself hired.[A][ClearBox]But I don't like this General Lang guy either.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]If you're alright with it, I'll lend you my sword.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Have you forgotten, Oguma?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Samto[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Samto, the gladiator from Knorda?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes,[Pause=3] I was a slave gladiator at the time,[Pause=3]
and you really helped me out.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Even when everyone was making their
escape, you stayed behind to distract
the guards and ended up caught[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I heard everything[Pause=3] from my friends.[A][ClearBox]How you were dragged out to the square[Pause=3]
and whipped until you looked like a corpse.[A][ClearBox]How, by chance,[Pause=3] the young Princess Talis,
tears in her eyes, stood up for you and
saved you.[A][ClearBox]And that's why you swore your blade
to Talis.[A][ClearBox]Or rather[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] to the princess[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Enough[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Say no more[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

When I heard you were taken from the
village in Macedonia, I was really worried.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Lang wanted me to help him deal with the
Grunia rebellion, so he took me here.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But, as the archbishop of Khadein, and with
your power, you shouldn't need to fear Lang.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I don't like using magic in battle. I
already left the magic city, Khadein, in the
care of two youths, Marich and Ellerean.[A][ClearBox]I left because I must fulfill a
mission assigned to me by Archsage Gato.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]A mission from Lord Gato?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's correct[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]You have seen the "Star Orb"[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
the holy orb with the twelve constellations
etched on its surface.[A][ClearBox]In order to pierce Garnef's shadowy veil,
Lord Gato created a sacred spell named
"Starlight" from that orb.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MS006_ED1_2
[TargetLeft]Unfortunately,[Pause=3] the strain on the Star Orb
was so severe that it shattered into twelve
shards, which scattered into the sky.[A][ClearBox]Lord Gato told me that this world has long
been guarded by five orbs of mysterious
arcane power,[A][ClearBox]and that if even one of them is lost,
the world will fall into irreparable ruin.[A][ClearBox]By any means possible, we must gather the
twelve star shards and restore the
Star Orb. Unfortunately, I was captured[A][ClearBox]and the fragments that I laboriously collected
were taken by the imperial soldiers.
Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox]I realise that I cannot complete my
mission just by myself. Can you aid
me in my quest?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Is this a joke[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth]
That the world could just end...
This is all very hard to take in.[A][ClearBox]But aren't these the star shards?[A][ClearBox]If so, we already have a few.[A][ClearBox]After we retake Aritia, we'd be glad to help
you find the remaining shards and orbs.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Your country was only just invaded by the
Empire[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]I understand, Prince[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I too shall fight to restore Aritia, then.[A][ClearBox]Thinking about it, my meeting with you
is like a sign from Lord Gato himself.[A][ClearBox]In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]But, please, let's stop by the Raman Temple.[A][ClearBox]We may be able to find some star shards in
the ancient temple.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Understood.[Pause=3]

Do we continue as we are or take a longer,
safer route[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Personally, I'd rather not detour.[Pause=3]
