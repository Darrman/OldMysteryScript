[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=EST][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ABEL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Abel[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]
Est,[Pause=3] you haven't been in an actual battle for
a while. Try not to overdo it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I told you I'm alright[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Sure, I'm not at my
peak, but my skill as a former Whitewing
hasn't faded just yet.[A][ClearBox]But nevermind me, Abel, I don't want you to
get hurt, either.[A][ClearBox]If you'd like, I could let you ride my pegasus.[Pause=3]
That way, you wouldn't get a scratch on you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You said it.[A][ClearBox]I used to be an Aritian knight, you know.
They called me "Abel the Black Panther."[A][ClearBox]No mere soldier could possibly hope to defeat
me.[A][ClearBox]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] If I were to ride with you though, I'd be
able to protect you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Eh?[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Oh dear.[A][ClearBox]Sorry, Abel.
I, um, don't think that he wants you to ride
him. [A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I-I see.[Pause=3]
I knew it; so he really does hate me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Even back home, he'd go out of his way to
savage me each time I tried to touch him.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You ending up getting kicked all the time too...[A][ClearBox]Heehee, you were so certain that you'd need
to get along with him in order to be family
with me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]And in the end, I couldn't even pat his head[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=EST][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ABEL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Sigh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What's wrong, Est?
Why the long face?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Abel.[Pause=3]
No, it's nothing.[A][ClearBox]I was just thinking about stuff.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see.[Pause=3]
That's okay then.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Say, Abel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Once this war is over, will things[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=3]will we
really be able to go back to how we used to
be?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Of course. In fact, I'm sure we'll be happier
than before.[A][ClearBox]We'll expand the shop, have children[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ec]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] yeah.[Pause=3]
Yeah, that's right.
Of course.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Est[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Are you really alright?[A][ClearBox]That isn't the smile I'm accustomed to.
Are you forcing yourself, Est?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]Ahaha, 'c-course not.
But anyway, Abel. What do you think we
should name our child?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Ah, yes.
Let's see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ABEL_EST_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=EST][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Sigh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What should[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I do[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ABEL]Est, my love[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
So you were here.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]Abel, what is it?
You look so flustered.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I heard from Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox]You've been terribly worried about something,
haven't you?[A][ClearBox]What is it, dear?[Pause=3]
If there's something the matter, tell me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_LOVE2][Pause=3][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Say, Abel.[Pause=3]
Why did you fall in love with me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]T-that's[Pause=3] uh... rather sudden.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Please, Abel. I must know.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Good grief[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]It was so... natural, I never gave it a second
thought.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ah,[Pause=2] are you crying[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm sorry, I'll answer properly this time[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Err[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ABEL_EST_A_2
[TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed][FaceCommand=0x73]Abel, thank you.[Pause=3]
It's okay.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Eh[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] was more than enough. I get it.[A][ClearBox]Hey, scoot closer.
Now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Just for now, hold me tightly in your arms.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Est[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
We'll always be together...[A][ClearBox]So, don't cry anymore.
It hurts me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] to see you cry.[A][ClearBox]The thought of you all alone, with no one to
turn to[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'm afraid to leave your side... 
Afraid to depart for battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm sorry.[Pause=3]
Teehee, I'm so silly.[A][ClearBox]I guess all this fighting's been taking its toll
on me.[A][ClearBox]Sorry, Abel.[Pause=3]
I'm okay now.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Let us stay like this, just a little longer[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, Est[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_JORJUE_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=JORJUE][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Sorry,[Pause=1] George.[A]
I shouldn't have forced you[Pause=2] to stall that
battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No,[Pause=1] I don't mind.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]As a knight of Akaneia,[Pause=3] your conduct was
impeccable as always.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But,[Pause=2] it's been years since we've been able
to chat like this.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]Yeah.[Pause=3]
This brings back memories.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]I was[Pause=1] just a simple mercenary commander[Pause=3]
and you, a single bow knight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FaceCommand=0x73]Heh heh,[Pause=1] it's been a while.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]There...[Pause=3] was someone else too.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]You mean Midia?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah.[A][ClearBox]She was always grumpy when you[Pause=3] came to
Pales.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's because[Pause=3] Midia believed wholeheartedly
in the Akaneian knights.[A][ClearBox]She probably thought[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] that mercenaries
were a blight on the force.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Hang on a moment.[Pause=3]
[FaceCommand=0x73]Don't act like you had nothing to do with it.[A][ClearBox]Who was it[Pause=2] that picked a fight with the
female commander over everything?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Gah,[Pause=1] that was[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_JORJUE_C_2
[TargetRight]I remember hearing your voices echoing 
throughout Pales: her orders, and your
rebuttals.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Do you honestly believe any self-respecting 
mercenary could stand being told to
"leave this army at once and go home"?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm pretty sure there were[Pause=2] other mercenaries
there too.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
By any chance,[Pause=1] were you the one[Pause=1] who mistook
Midia for a man,[A]
and got in trouble for it[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Bah,[Pause=1] of all the things[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[EyeCommand=ed]That is utter nonsense.[A][ClearBox]Her silken locks,[Pause=3] that heavenly face,
radiating her pride and sense of duty[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]It would take a tasteless scoundrel with no
eye for beauty to see her as anything less
than a goddess.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Astria[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
That[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] might be too much information, thank
you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Honestly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
You might just be the most entertaining
person I know.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Tch.[A]
[EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm heading back.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]Hmm.[Pause=3]
Did I go too far?[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_JORJUE_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=JORJUE][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Oh right,[Pause=1] George.[Pause=3]
Do you remember?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That final attack[Pause=1] of yours[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
In our[Pause=1] last practice.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes,[Pause=1] I remember.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]It surprised me quite a bit[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Did you aim there on purpose?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Of course.[A][ClearBox]I was originally[Pause=3] a mounted soldier, my friend.[A]
[FaceCommand=0x61]It's not as hard[Pause=1] as it looks.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Then,[Pause=3] do all bow knights learn tricks like
that[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]It was a joke.
That was the first time[Pause=2] I pulled it off in a
real battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]George[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]My heart was welling up with admiration for
a moment there.[Pause=3] Give it back[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]Haha,[Pause=1] sorry about that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Do you remember?
After that training session.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]
Midia was furious. She really put you through
the wringer.[A]
Er, oops[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_JORJUE_B_2
[TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Wha-[Pause=1] How[Pause=2] did you[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I told you, Astria.[A]
Your voices[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=3]they echoed.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]"Why in god's name[Pause=1] didn't you retaliate!?"[A]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I think that's what Midia said.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]What she said[Pause=1] really got to you, didn't it?[A][ClearBox]All of us sympathized with you that time.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Bah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FaceCommand=0x61]Whoops,[Pause=2] I've [EyeCommand=ed]gone too far again.[Pause=3]
[FaceCommand=0x73]Sorry about that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]N-no[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It's okay.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F32][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So,[Pause=3] Astria.[A][ClearBox][Music=BGM_EVT_GRAVE1]Today,[Pause=3] you're going to tell me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You want me to tell you about Hardin[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Am I correct in assuming so?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Exactly.[A][ClearBox]I highly doubt you hadn't noticed anything.
Not after receiving Miracle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You'll tell me, right?[Pause=3]
Well, Astria?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Yes.[A][ClearBox]So,[Pause=1] you had best listen carefully.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_JORJUE_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=JORJUE][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]In short,[Pause=3] Prince Marth was my target.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Your loyalty to your liege was absolute, was
it not[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Well?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's correct.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sigh.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][FaceCommand=0x73]As stuffy as ever,[Pause=3] eh, old friend?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Wh-[Pause=1]what's wrong with being a little adamant?![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Precisely.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]You take something on,[Pause=1] think too much about
it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] and then blindly cling to your conclusions.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth][UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Of course,[Pause=3] I do believe you were right this
time.[A]
As a knight, that is.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] as a friend,[Pause=2] I'm not so sure.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]As a[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][EyeCommand=ed][Pause=2] friend[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]Astria,[Pause=1] listen.
You should[Pause=3] trust people more.[A][ClearBox]There's nary a knight who doesn't know of
your unshakable loyalty.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]And of course,[Pause=1] I'm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] one of them.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_JORJUE_A_2
[TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]George.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I want to[Pause=1] help you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ec]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I get it.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Truly,[Pause=3] I absolutely agree with you.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You have my deepest thanks,[Pause=3] George.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Heh heh,[Pause=3] this certainly is a change.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course.[A][ClearBox]You aren't ever[Pause=3] this serious when there's
nobody else around[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I know you're[Pause=3] being considerate.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Haha,[Pause=1] indeed.[Pause=3]
This time, you really do understand, Astria.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Heh,[Pause=1] how long[Pause=3] [FaceCommand=0x73]have we known each other, eh?[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Anyway.[A]
Enough of the past.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Don't die,[Pause=2] George.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah.[Pause=3]
You too, Astria.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_MIDIA_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MIDIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You continue to improve.
I'm glad I've had the opportunity to see that
for myself, Midia dear.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You too, Astria[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm amazed at your technique. 
I can barely defend myself as I am now.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]It's a pity Aritia's finances are sorely[Pause=3]
lacking. We can barely afford to equip
ourselves with what little we have now.[A][ClearBox]A war of attrition will only serve to destroy
us.[A][ClearBox]In short, unless each and every soldier
continues to improve, we have no chance of
victory.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]You speak truly.
The battle will likely grow more fierce with
each passing day.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Although[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] the rate at which everyone is
improving fills me with this strange sense of
anxiety. I can't quite explain it.[A][ClearBox]It seems as though if I were to become
complacent, then I would fall far behind.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]As a knight of Akaneia, t'would be a
passing shame if we could not surpass these
foreign knights.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]If we are to lead the vanguard, and rescue
our fair queen[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] we must be focused.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]That task...
That one task is one we cannot entrust to
any other.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh, Midia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] 
Should we rest a short while?
We're both out of breath.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]No, please, allow me to continue.[Pause=3]
I'm not entirely satisfied with myself thus far.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Very well.[Pause=3]

Midia, are you okay[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Forgive my carelessness[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed][Music=BGM_EVT_PEACEFUL1]Mm, I'm fine.
'Tis just a scratch[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] 
Don't worry.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][Pause=3]Teeheehee.[A][ClearBox]I just remembered... our first duel.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Eh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ahaha, that time, you sent me flying across
the room[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I was pretty roughed up that time.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I sobbed into my pillow all night.[A][ClearBox]I really, really despised you.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Heehee, it was a big moment for me.
I'm the way I am now thanks to that loss.[A][ClearBox]I trained so much harder, just to reach your
level.[A][ClearBox]Besides[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Besides?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You had such an ice-cold look on your face
at the time.[A][ClearBox]Now? Your eyes are so much softer[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
It makes me really happy.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Midia[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'll see if I can find myself a vulnerary.
Please wait a moment.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]That reminds me, we[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

May I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] hold your hand?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Eh?[Pause=3]
Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Of course.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][Music=BGM_EVT_LOVE2][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]They're so silken[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
It's hard to believe these are the hands of
a battle-hardened warrior[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]It's been some time since we've sat together
like this, and just held hands.[Pause=3]
It's kind of ticklish.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Indeed.[Pause=3]
We've done nothing but train since our
reunion[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What's wrong, Astria?
Are you alright?[A][ClearBox]Why are you so insecure?[A][ClearBox]You can hold me as tightly as you want, 
whenever you want. It makes me happy.[A][ClearBox]We'll always be together, no matter what[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Isn't that right, my love?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I know that a lot of people say I'm too
hard-nosed.[A][ClearBox]Even though I've finally got you here in my
arms, I've done naught but train.[A][ClearBox]I don't believe I've spoken a single word of
comfort to you.[A][ClearBox]Even though we're in the middle of a
campaign, I thought I should give more value
to the time I spend with you.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]I'm sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]My, you don't need to apologize.[Pause=3]
I wanted to train with you too.[A][ClearBox]We'll have all the time in the world to whisper
sweet nothings after the war.[Pause=3] And I think[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
that would be for the best.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Then, we're both stubborn fools.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Teehee, indeed.[Pause=3]
Then, can I ask for one last spar?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Alright.
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I won't hold back, okay?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course.[A][ClearBox][X]

powerful, but it is also your weakness.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What do you mean?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I mean[Pause=3] you vacillate.[Pause=3]
Ergo, you aren't sure of yourself, and you

[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Oh right, I think I heard about that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sir Jeigan told us yesterday.
Have you forgotten already?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Eh, well, that's strange[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I didn't intend to.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're such an airhead, you know?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]R-really?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Misbuttoning your clothes, wearing two right
gloves[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] How do you plan to tell me otherwise?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Did that sort of thing happen[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes.[Pause=3]
I lent you a left glove because you had two
right ones.[A][ClearBox]Then, you lost that too.[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ohh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I remember now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm?[Pause=3]
The war council?[Pause=3]
Or the left glove?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Jeigan told me he had that glove, so he
asked me to go and collect it during the war
council.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'm fairly sure he had a different set of
gloves in mind.[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=ROBERTO][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=LEIDEN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Leiden, don't just throw away everything
you own.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]...?[Pause=3]
What are you talking about?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You've a habit of throwing away anything
you don't need[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]They once got really mad at you when[Pause=3] you
threw an old, dirty book away.[A][ClearBox]"How dare you! It was a precious textbook[FreezeMouth]!!"[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
they said.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Don't even remind me.[Pause=3]
I got in some real trouble that time.[A][ClearBox]But that happened all the way back home.[A][ClearBox]I'm just organizing my things now.
Did I throw away something I shouldn't have?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Isn't this book Sir Jeigan's?[Pause=3]
I remember borrowing it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth]

[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]That was a close one.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Your detachment from material things is one

That's why I came back early.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You never get lost anywhere[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You should share some of that sense of

weaknesses.[A][ClearBox]But I think Dame [SpecialText0x14=0x39]'ll survive no matter
where she goes.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Haha, maybe.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Meanwhile, if you weren't a knight, you'd be
some dull fellow leading a gray life
somewhere[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hey, you're going too far.[Pause=3]

Argh, it's so hard to choose.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Luke.[Pause=3] Do you think you could stop giving me
bizarre nicknames? Also, stop staring at me

How about[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] "Cold-eyes"?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That sounds like an insult to me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Am I really that cold?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Fine, what good ideas have you got then?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I need no nicknames.[Pause=3]
And besides, nicknames are supposed to come
naturally, right?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Come on, I know you actually want one; you
can't fool me![A][ClearBox]So, I'll help you think of a fine nickname: one

How about "Should Be More Serious!"?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][TargetLeft]You don't like it?[Pause=3]
Then, how about "Oh Dear, He's Crazy..."?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Alright, I get it already[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]

MBTK_ROOK_RODY_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=ROOK][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RODY][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Hey Rody, why did you volunteer to become
a knight?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]My family is poor.[Pause=3]
It's simple really. If I want my family to eat,
I need to earn money for them.[A][ClearBox]So, if you're asking for my reason, it would
be family[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] That's the gist of it, I suppose.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's a pretty heavy reason.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then, what made you volunteer, Luke?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, me?
[Pause=3][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Because knights get all the ladies, duh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What.[Pause=3]
You volunteered to be a knight to get laid?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]W-well, kinda[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]......[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What's wrong with that[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
As long as I do my job right, how do my
motives matter[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed.[Pause=3]
I can't deny that your performance has
been stellar.[A][ClearBox]But the thought that you've only come this
far because of the "lay-deez" sends
shivers down my spine[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]You're an idiot.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Hahaha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Well, to each his own, they say.[A][ClearBox][X]

What are you talking about?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]About your motive for becoming a knight.[Pause=3]
Why did you make up that story about
attracting girls?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Who told you?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sir Jeigan.[Pause=3]
He told me during a war council the other
day.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Damn.[Pause=3]
I guess I've got nowhere to hide now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So you volunteered to become a knight in
place of your older brother,[A][ClearBox]who became bedridden right when he was
about to receive the title himself.[A][ClearBox]That's a splendid reason: one you should be
proud of.[Pause=3] Why lie?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]It isn't splendid, and it isn't anything to be
proud of.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]My family has served in the Aritian knights
for generations.[A][ClearBox]In other words[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I was forced to volunteer
as my brother's substitute, to protect my
family's honor.[A][ClearBox]But you see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'm me.[Pause=3] I'm not my brother[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
I'm not some stinking substitute[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Luke[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So, I decided to volunteer on my own steam.[Pause=3]
[Pause=3][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]For all the women of this world, naturally.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Let's just leave it at that.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]I'm counting on you, partner. Let's hope we
get a girlfriend or two with our dashing
visages and peerless chivalry.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Hahah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

[TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, of course.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]A mercenary[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] is oftentimes forced to serve
a master[Pause=1] with whom he does not agree,
correct?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]That[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] depends on the mercenary.[A][ClearBox]If you don't like them,[Pause=3] then don't work with
them.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]That's what I reckon,[Pause=1] at any rate. 
I'll not cheapen my ideals for anyone.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see.[Pause=3]
Thank goodness[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hm?[Pause=3]
What do you mean?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Ah,[Pause=1] no, it's nothing.[Pause=3]
I'm just talking to myself.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see.[A]
Well, if that's an acceptable answer,[Pause=3] then
all is well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Uh,[Pause=1] Samson.[A][ClearBox]There is one more[Pause=1] thing I'd like to ask you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]So many questions today[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Go ahead,[Pause=1] Sheema.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Thank you.[Pause=3]

MBTK_SAMSON_SIMA_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SIMA][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=SAMSON][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Samson, you used[Pause=3] to protect a village[Pause=1] near
Akaneia Palace, long ago, correct?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah.[Pause=3]
It was a good place to live.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Well,[Pause=3] this is just hearsay but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Hm? [Pause=2]What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I've heard that Pales town[Pause=3] is a
wonderful place to shop.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]I, um[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'm unfamiliar[Pause=1] with the area so[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=eh]So, I was[Pause=2] wondering[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][EyeCommand=ed][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]If it would be okay with you,[Pause=3] would you escort
me[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Of course.[Pause=3]
An easy task.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I'm so happy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[FaceCommand=0x61]Err,[Pause=3] I mean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=1]
You have my gratitude.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah.[Pause=3]
But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2] there is one slight problem.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SAMSON_SIMA_A_2
[TargetRight]Huh?[Pause=1] What would that be?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Pales town is huge.[A]
You cannot possibly go around[Pause=3] all of it in
just one or two days.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]I wonder if[Pause=3] Prince Marth will emerge
victorious.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]Huh?[A][ClearBox]Oh,[Pause=2] yes.[Pause=3]
Most likely.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]If that should happen,[Pause=3] m'lady will probably[Pause=2]
live in Pales.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Samson,[Pause=1] do you mean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You can come anytime,[Pause=1] Sheema.[A]
I'll[Pause=1] be right there.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_RADEI_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SEAZER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RADEI][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Did you like the book I lent you the other
day, Raddy? Was it informative?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][Pause=3]Uhh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Y-yes[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It sure was[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] I feel so much stronger already![A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You could just admit to me you hadn't read
it. I won't get mad.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ahahaha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] sorry[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
The letters are too small[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
It's kind of hard to read.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Your fencing style is self-taught.
I'll admit that you're skilled, but it might
cause you problems in the future.[A][ClearBox]So[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] read, Raddy. Read. 
You need to get some real instruction.
You'll regret it later, if you don't.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]I know that![Pause=3]
I'm just[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] no good at book-learnin'.[A][ClearBox]It just goes right out of my head as soon as
I head into battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Good heavens[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's because you feel your way through
fights.[A][ClearBox]If you could combine that with a little formal
knowledge[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Why, you'd be the strongest mercenary on
the continent![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The strongest on the continent[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Who, m-me[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, you.[Pause=3]
You've got a ton of potential in you, Raddy.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Really[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I guarantee it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Caesar[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Can I borrow your book for a little longer[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sure.
If there's anything you don't understand,
just ask.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]That attitude of his[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] isn't going to change,
is it?[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_RADEI_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SEAZER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RADEI][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Raddy, we have to talk.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Wha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What was that pathetic display of
swordsmanship?[Pause=3] Do that on a battlefield,
and you'd be dead in seconds.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ah, well, y'see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'm feeling a little sick today.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]We mercenaries fight on the frontlines;
our blades lashing out at the enemy.[A][ClearBox]Do you really think that I'd let a poor excuse
like that slide?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]N-no[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
The truth is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I was testing out a style from that book.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Book[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You mean the one I lent you?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah. 
The minute I gave it a shot[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I understood.[Pause=3]
I can't fight with those techniques.[A][ClearBox]I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get stronger
learning like this, Caesar.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Actually, I was wondering if that wasn't the
case, myself.[A][ClearBox]Your strength lies in your instincts. 
You've got a very primal style.[A][ClearBox]I suppose it'd be a problem if we tried to
dilute it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Got it.[Pause=3]
I'll have to work hard to get stronger, my
own way.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It's a pity. 
I really did think you'd be the strongest,
if you learned how to fence properly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]There you go again.[Pause=3]
It can't be helped if I can't do it.
Well, there goes that dream![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I wasn't lying, you know.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SEAZER_RADEI_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SEAZER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RADEI][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What?
You've been staring at me for quite some
time. Can't you see I'm reading?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You're incredible, Caesar.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's not sudden at all.[Pause=3]
You want something from me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, that's not it[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're always giving it your all, right?
Doing your best to get stronger, I mean.[A][ClearBox]Learning tactics from difficult books,
sparring with all kinds of opponents,
and learning new techniques[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]We're fighting in a war.[Pause=3]
I just want to raise my chances of survival,
even by the tiniest amount.[A][ClearBox]This army has[Pause=3] many skilled warriors.
There's a lot I can learn from them.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Guys like you are probably those "first-rate
mercenaries" that everyone talks about.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]If that's how you feel, why not follow my
example?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I just can't.[Pause=3] This is the only way I can fight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Improvising my way out of the worst
scrimmage.[A][ClearBox]Caesar[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=2]
Please don't ever leave me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What are you spouting now?[Pause=3]
Of course I won't leave you.[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Now shoo. You're distracting me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Heh heh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight]How can Raddy even say things like that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
His style's been improving each battle.[A][ClearBox]I've got to be careful I don't fall behind him.[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

protecting me in the last battle, am I right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]So you noticed.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I know, because you're always watching out
for me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'm sure you suffered far more wounds that
I'm not aware of.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course not.
Have confidence in my abilities, Princess.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm sorry.
I've caused you so much bother[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Please raise your head.
My life is yours.[A][ClearBox]You needn't concern yourself with my wounds.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oguma[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Please give that vulnerary to Marth.
I have no need for it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I had this vulnerary concocted especially for
you.[A][ClearBox]I want you to use it![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Very well.[Pause=3]
Then, I shall gladly accept it.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_OGUMA_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SHEEDA][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=OGUMA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Hello,[Pause=2] Oguma.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Princess.
Is there something you want?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I just wanted to thank you for saving me
again.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No need.
It's my duty to protect you and the prince.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you, Oguma.[A][ClearBox]With you by our side, Marth and I can fight
as freely as the wind.[A][ClearBox]I've no doubt that there are few battles
over which we cannot triumph.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I am hardly deserving of such high praise.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I do worry about one little thing though:
Your habit of never relying on others[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'm afraid, Oguma. 
I'm afraid you'll leave us one day.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Please don't forget, Oguma.[A][ClearBox]As you protect us, we too shall protect you.[A][ClearBox]You are not alone.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes.[A][ClearBox][X]

[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Princess.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][Music=BGM_EVT_PEACEFUL1]Hee hee, you let your guard down for a

sneak up on you.[A][ClearBox]I'm glad you've started to trust us.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]True. I don't feel like an island anymore.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]That was a big fault of mine.[A][ClearBox]It never once crossed my mind to rely on
someone else in battle.[A][ClearBox]That[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] probably means I've grown weaker.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_SHEEDA_OGUMA_A_2
[TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]That's not true.[Pause=3]
You haven't become weaker.[A][ClearBox]If anything, you've only gotten stronger since
I first met you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Having something to protect and having the
relief, knowing somebody is protecting me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]You say I've grown stronger thanks to that?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, that's what I believe.[Pause=3]
I'm the same[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]It's so mysterious.[A][ClearBox]Hearing it from you, it really does feel like
I've become stronger.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Teehee.[A][ClearBox]I must pray to the goddess of fortune for
that strength of yours to always be with me.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then, to answer to your expectations,
I hereby vow to fight to the end, as your

What business do you have with me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Your mask[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'd like to see the face behind it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I understand that you have your reasons 
for hiding your indentity. But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Still, I'd like to ask this of you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And if I say no?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then please tell me why.[A][ClearBox]I was once a Sable Knight of Grunia.
I was one of the enemy then.[A][ClearBox]Even so, Prince Marth has accepted me into
his army.[A][ClearBox]The prince looks beyond trivialties such as
nationality[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]There should be no need to disguise yourself,
I would think.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Belf,[Pause=3] I believe you've mistaken me for
another. Please leave me be.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]General[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You are mistaken. I am no general.[Pause=3]
I am Sirius[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Merely Sirius.[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=SIRIUS][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BELF][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]That was a magnificent battle, Sir Sirius.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Belf[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I recall asking you to leave me be.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It matters not if you wear a mask.[Pause=3]
I can tell from your fighting style.
That's Grunian spear technique.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It seems that our misunderstanding still
stands.[Pause=3] 'Tis a pity.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I understand.[Pause=3]
If you are so strongly intent on hiding
yourself, I won't force you.[A][ClearBox]But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
At least tell me.[Pause=3]
Why? Why go so far to hide it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]General[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]For argument's sake,[Pause=3] if I were in fact the
Grunian general you claim I am, Sir Belf[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]What do you think would result from my
revealing myself?[A][ClearBox]A resistance would rise, and I would be their
symbol. I would provide the impetus needed to
free Grunia.[A][ClearBox]I hardly think now is the time for further
Grunian blood to be spilt.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Now, if you'll excuse me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

I'd like to apologize for my rudeness.

Very well, I shall take my leave.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Please wait.[Pause=3] Would you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] mind keeping me

About the past, I mean.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]The general who led the Grunian Sable
Order, which I was a member of, was a
wonderful person.[A][ClearBox]He used to tell us this:
A knight's spear is not for himself.
It exists to protect the weak.[A][ClearBox]I've come thus far holding his words to my
heart. But[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] even though I chose this path,[Pause=3]
I wonder if I made the right choice[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Sir Sirius, if the general were alive, do you
think he'd have anything to say to me?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Belf[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I am proud to have you as my subordinate.[A][ClearBox]I want you to keep protecting the people, in
my stead, for I've already departed from
