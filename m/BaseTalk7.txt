[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ABEL][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]You're[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] [SpecialText0x14=0x39], right?
Why the befuddled look on your face?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh, Sir Abel[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]The truth is[Pause=3] I'm trying to light a fire,[Pause=3]
but to no avail.[A][ClearBox]I was considering going to the storehouse
to collect another flintstone, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Ah, I have a flintstone if you need one.[Pause=3]
Here, take it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, thanks.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Use this tinderbox as well,
if you think it'll be useful.[Pause=3]
I have some pieces of wood, too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Y-you're awfully well prepared,[Pause=3] Sir Abel.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I used to run a small shop in Aritia, you see.[Pause=3]
I dealt with these kind of items there.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's why.[Pause=3]
In that case, I should be paying you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Nah, no need.[Pause=3]
Just tell me whenever you want them.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I appreciate the favor, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Is it really okay?[Pause=3]
Won't it be problematic for a merchant
if you give away things for free?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Yeah, if you put it that way[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Est often got mad at me for it,[Pause=3]
saying the shop would go bankrupt because
I'm too nice[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ABEL_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ABEL][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]I heard[Pause=3] you fought in the previous war
as a knight of Aritia, Sir Abel.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah.[Pause=3] I was particularly close to Kain.[Pause=3]
We were friends and rivals who endeavored
to surpass each other.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]May I ask why you resigned[Pause=3]
from knighthood?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I wasn't discontent or anything.[Pause=3]
However, I had this dream of opening a
shop in Aritia.[A][ClearBox]To live a quiet life with my wife,
while running a small shop[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I longed for a simple life like that.[A][ClearBox]Of course, part of me[Pause=3]
still wanted to serve as an Aritian knight.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes.[Pause=3]
I can tell that intention clearly from
when I see you fight.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Being a knight and opening a shop[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Both were very precious to me.[A][ClearBox]I worried about it for a long time[Pause=3]
and in the end chose the shop,[Pause=3]
but leaving the knighthood was hard.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]When you have two things precious to you,[Pause=3]
it's quite hard to achieve them both[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ABEL_A
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ABEL][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I met Est[Pause=3] during the previous war.[A][ClearBox]She was cheerful and pure,[Pause=3] and we were
drawn to each other as we fought together.[A][ClearBox]It was a modest life,[Pause=3] but I was really happy 
to run the shop with her.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Just by listening to you describe it,[Pause=3]
I can already picture your days
of happiness.[A][ClearBox]Once this war is over,[Pause=3]
that peace should return.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You're right.[A][ClearBox]By the way, do you perchance have a lover?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]No, I am a knight after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It isn't written anywhere[Pause=3]
that knights are forbidden to love.[A][ClearBox]Don't you think Prince Marth[Pause=3]
would be happy if you managed to
find yourself a lover?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I-I'll do my best.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]But, that's right[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If you do find somebody precious to you,[Pause=3]
be careful.[A][ClearBox]If you have two people important to you,[Pause=3]
you might be driven into a dilemma[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Abel[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Back when Est was taken hostage by the
Akaneian army[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]That time,[Pause=3] I had to make a terrible choice.[A][ClearBox]Est or Prince Marth?[Pause=3]
Which one should I choose?[Pause=3]
Both were precious to me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ABEL_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]In the end[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I couldn't choose either.[Pause=3]
No matter how much I pondered,
I just couldn't.[A][ClearBox]When you have two things precious to you,[Pause=3]
it's quite hard to achieve them both[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And even now, after all that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I don't know what I should have done.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I believe you did[Pause=3]
the best you could, Sir Abel.[A][ClearBox]And besides, what's important,
more than the past[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] is the future.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're right,[Pause=3]
you hit the nail on the head.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]After this war is over[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I want you to come to my shop.[Pause=3]
I'll give you a personal discount.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks, Sir Abel.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Astria[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
No, Sir Astria.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Is that weapon for training?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What's wrong,[Pause=3] why won't you begin?[A][ClearBox]Or would you rather[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
we continue our fight from before?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Cashmere Bridge,[Pause=3] Khadein,[Pause=3]
and then Aritia Castle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]The two of us have fought many times
as enemies.[A][ClearBox]I'm sure you must harbor some resentment
towards me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Prince Marth has accepted you.[Pause=3]
Therefore, you're our ally.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]However,[Pause=3] I'd be lying if I said
I held no ill feelings towards you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Naturally.[A][ClearBox]Then,[Pause=3] shall we begin?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I have no interest in a battle to the death.[A][ClearBox]However, if you want an one-on-one duel,[Pause=3]
then I'd love to.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Excellent.[Pause=3]
If that's what you choose,
then I shall be your opponent[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sir Astria.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Somebody interrupted our last duel.[A][ClearBox]I'm sure you weren't fully satisfied.[Pause=3]
So, shall we continue it now?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I'd love to.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What's wrong, why are you hesitating?[A][ClearBox]You've been fighting excellently.[Pause=3]
There's no reason for you to hesitate.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I've been thinking about my reason
to fight you.[A][ClearBox]Whether this would be proof of my
loyalty to Prince Marth or not[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's my only concern.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm your enemy, am I not?[A][ClearBox]Is loyalty more important?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's right.[Pause=3] Do you find that odd?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, I'm the same.[Pause=3]
Nothing is more important to me than
my loyalty to Princess Nina.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I see,[Pause=3]
so that's the kind of knight you are.[A][ClearBox]That's why you pursued us relentlessly,[Pause=3]
and why you're here with us now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's true.[Pause=3] Everything derives from my
loyalty to the princess.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I changed my mind,[Pause=3] Sir Astria.[Pause=3]
Let's leave our duel for another day.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Fine.[Pause=3] I'll be your opponent anytime.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Astria.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]When I fought beside you,[Pause=3]
I understood something.[A][ClearBox]In the beginning, you were our enemy[SpecialSymbol=0x96][Pause=3]
one I had sworn to strike down with
my own hands.[A][ClearBox]However, you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] aren't a bad person.[Pause=3]
Even I know that much.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I might have given you the wrong idea,[Pause=3]
but I don't wish to fight you anymore.[A][ClearBox]Now, I just[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]wish to apologize to you all.[Pause=3]
That's it.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Apologize[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I didn't expect to obtain that forgiveness
through words.[A][ClearBox]So, at the very least, I hoped to use
a duel as an apology.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So in order to apologize to us,[Pause=3]
you accepted my challenge, even though
I considered you an enemy?[A][ClearBox]Even if it wasn't a duel to the death,[Pause=3]
didn't you consider the possibility[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
that I could try and kill you?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ASTRIA_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I couldn't help it.[Pause=3]
I didn't know any other way to apologize.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You're a clumsy man, aren't you?[A][ClearBox]But, I might have misunderstood you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Astria.[Pause=3]
I want to test you.[A][ClearBox]I'd like to duel with you right now.[Pause=3]
However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Not by clashing anger with anger[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But in deference to each other,[Pause=3]
seeking to best each other in battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Very well, I accept.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ATHENA_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ATHENA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]So here you were, Miss Athena.[A][ClearBox]It's almost time for the war council.[Pause=3]
We'd like you to attend as well.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Vorcounsel[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Vat is a vorcounsel?[Pause=3]
Is it round and sveet?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]N-no, that's not it.[Pause=3]
A war council isn't something you eat[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]You see, a war council is[Pause=3]
a discussion with everyone,
held before the next battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]In that case, ve understand.[Pause=3]
Ve are in your debt.[A][ClearBox]Ve are from foreign country,[Pause=3]
ve came riding the sea.[Pause=3]
The vords here, ve find difficult.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[Pause=3]
Well, it can't be helped if you

if you wish?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]All sorts of things?[A][ClearBox]You mean indecent things?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]N-no, that's not it.[Pause=3]
Where on earth did you get that idea[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Anyway,[Pause=3] if there's any word you don't
understand, feel free to ask me anytime.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Ve are grateful.[A][ClearBox]And glad because you are not indecent.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Thanks.[A][ClearBox]Oh and "thanks" means[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Ve know that much. Stupid manchild.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]I-I'm sorry.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ATHENA_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ATHENA][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]And so[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Reconnaissance is checking on the enemy's
conditions before the battle begins.[A][ClearBox]I suppose that's about it.[Pause=3]
Did you understand, Miss Athena?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes. Ve are indebted to you.[A][ClearBox]Ve learned a lot.[Pause=3]
It is all thanks to you, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]No, I'm happy to be of service to you,

the vay people live[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]They are very complicated.[Pause=3]
Ve are often very surprised.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is life in your country[Pause=3]
that different from ours, Miss Athena?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. Completely different.[A][ClearBox]But ve came to this country.[Pause=3]
So, as sign of respect, ve must[Pause=3]
get used to the vay of life of this country.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I think that's admirable.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]In our country,[Pause=3] ve have a saying.[A][ClearBox]"If you enter snow country,[Pause=3]
it becomes snow country."[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Is that saying[Pause=3] really like that?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ve don't know.[Pause=3]
Ve tried our best to translate into this
country's language.[A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ATHENA][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39],[Pause=3] thanks to you,

No no,[Pause=3] you used the wrong word again.[A][ClearBox]Didn't you mean "thank",[Pause=3] instead of
"apologize"?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes. "Thank".[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]As thanks, ve vill become your bride.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Wha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]M-Miss Athena[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Ve vill become [SpecialText0x14=0x39]'s voman?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

I've already received enough.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Ven?[Pause=3]
Ve don't remember giving any.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Be it in the battlefield or outside of it,[Pause=3]

MBTK_BECK_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BECK][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Yo, 'afternoon.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Good afternoon, Sir Beck.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, just call me Beck.[Pause=3]
Also, quit the formalities.[A][ClearBox]Being formal makes you sound so cold and
distant, don't you reckon?[A][ClearBox]So, let's talk[Pause=3] in a more natural way.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Alright, got it.[Pause=3]
Then I'll do just that, Beck.[Pause=3]
Nice to meet you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
I'm honored to make your acquaintance.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Er, weren't you being formal[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Oh well.[A][ClearBox]I heard from Prince Marth.[Pause=3]
You used[Pause=3] to be a ballistician, correct?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, I was originally a member of an army.[A][ClearBox]Even after the war was over, I travelled
the world with my ballista, but it eventually
stopped movin'[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]An accident?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_BECK_C_2
[TargetLeft]No, actually[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
In order to move a ballista,[Pause=3]
we need the oil from a special fruit.[A][ClearBox]However that fruit disappeared[Pause=3]
after the last war, see.[A][ClearBox]So you can attack with a ballista,[Pause=3]
but not move it[SpecialSymbol=0x96]and therefore, you can't
travel with it either.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Gettin' it to places would be just
too hard, see.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah, so that's why[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Indeed, none of the enemy ballisticians
we've faced in this war moved at all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, that's why I decided to choose this
guy to keep me company during my travels,[Pause=3]
instead of my old ballista.[A][ClearBox]I call 'im Pony.[Sound=SE_EVT_HORSE1][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see you've grown attached to him.[Pause=3]
He's a good horse.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetLeft]A pony among ponies you could say.[Sound=SE_EVT_HORSE1][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BECK_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][FaceCommand=0x73][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BECK][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Pony is really nice, see.[Pause=3]
He's a great listener, always
listenin' to everything I say.[A][ClearBox]I talk to 'im[Pause=3] when I'm feelin' lonely.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You talk to him?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah, Pony can understand what people say.[Sound=SE_EVT_HORSE1][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Really?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]'Course he can.[Pause=3]
Oh right, you want to try it out?
Go on, say something to 'im.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Eh?[Pause=3]
Do I really have to?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]'Course you do.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Oh well[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
H-hello, Pony.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Look, Pony.
He said "hello" to you,[Pause=3]
so, go on, greet 'im back.[A][ClearBox]There, look.[Pause=3]
He made a[Pause=3] "hello" face, didn't he?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]R-really?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Go on and talk more to 'im.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Eh, um, alright.[A][ClearBox]For how long have you been with
your master?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Look,[Pause=3] didn't he make a

He rescued me, when I was gonna be
thrown away for being too old.[A][ClearBox]And now he's my master.
He gives me carrots three times a day,
they're my favorite."[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]face just then?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-is that so[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BECK_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BECK][FaceCommand=0x73][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Yo, Mister [SpecialText0x14=0x39]. Good afternoon.[Pause=3]
I was just talking to Pony about you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]R-really?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Isn't that right, Pony?[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Look,[Pause=3] isn't that an "Exactly"[Pause=3] face?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I think that's just how you're feeling, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oh well.[Pause=3]
I brought a carrot for Pony today.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thank you.[Pause=3]
Aren't you glad, Pony?[Sound=SE_EVT_HORSE1][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Eh, Pony[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
How could you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Pony is a bit foul-mouthed,
but he's a nice fellow.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]How long do you intend to continue
with this act[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I used to get food with this act when
I lacked money during my travels, see.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So it really is an act[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well well,[Pause=3] your present is very
appreciated nonetheless, Mister [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]Look,[Pause=3] isn't this a "thank you" face?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Pony's?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No, mine.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BELF_C
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BELF][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Belf[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I know I'm being rude, but
there's something I'd like to ask you.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I don't mind. What can I help you with?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Are you well-versed in etiquette?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Etiquette?[Pause=3]
Well, I have some knowledge of it, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Why do you ask?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It's embarrassing, but I'm bad with
etiquette and decorum.[Pause=3]
I was just wondering if you could teach me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Is that so?[Pause=3]
As far as I'm aware, you've been 
managing flawlessly.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, not at all.[Pause=3]
I'm actually rather clumsy[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]For instance, castle manners[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
It quickly becomes apparent that I come
from the countryside.[A][ClearBox]Even recently, I got yelled at by
Sir Jeigan for running inside the castle[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] In that case...[A][ClearBox]I don't know how much help I'll be,
but alright.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BELF_B
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BELF][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Then, I'm counting on your assistance.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, alright.[A][ClearBox]By the way, was there a reason you asked
me about etiquette, and not anyone else?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, that's just the image I had of you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
To me, you look like a person of
fine upbringing.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You're a honest man[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Do I really look that way?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah, judging by your demeanor and table
manners.[Pause=3] That's why I thought you knew a lot
about etiquette.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I had no idea, but I suppose others would
see it that way.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The moment I saw you open doors and let
women go ahead of you, I knew it for sure.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Anybody can open a door, though.[Pause=3]
Do you want to give it a try?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh, me?[Pause=3]
But I'd do it poorly.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's highly unbecoming of you.[Pause=3]
Weren't you the one who was willing to
try anything?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ngh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'll give it a shot,
but don't say I didn't warn you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BELF_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BELF][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]It's difficult getting used to it.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Used to what?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Doors, opening doors[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]How to make use of the distance and timing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Opening a door is far harder than fighting[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You've improved greatly.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]R-really?[A][ClearBox]Hearing you say that makes me wonder
if I've finally become polite, or if you
no longer care[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, even if you don't master etiquette,
I think everyone already knows your
nature anyway.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Etiquette is just form, after all.[A][ClearBox]There are many well-born people who are
overly self-centered and thus unpleasant.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That might be true[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Still, you can't say it's wholly
irrelevant, either.[A][ClearBox]Oh, that reminds me, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
I believe your way of getting up from a
seated position is rather lacking in grace.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What, really[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Could I ask for some guidance?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Of course, do I have a choice?[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BIRAKU_C
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BIRAKU][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Sir Biraku.[Pause=3] It is an honor to be able to
fight alongside the prestigious Wolfguard.[Pause=3]
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, likewise.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Well, my original plan was to die for
Coyote, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Roshe convinced me otherwise.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Roshe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
He was the one who persuaded you
in the previous battle, wasn't he?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, we four Wolfguard members are
like siblings.[Pause=3]
Roshe has a good eye for people.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But, he's[Pause=3] a bit too kind, too.[A][ClearBox]He's much stronger than me in battle,
but he only makes a move when he
absolutely must.[A][ClearBox]That's why I fight in the front[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But it rarely goes well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Why? What happens?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]First[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I take one opponent down, right?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_BIRAKU_C_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]Yeah.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Then, I find myself surrounded by the
remaining enemies.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wait, what?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Then, when it's almost lights out for me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I'm rescued by Roshe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Well, that about sums up my battles.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That sounds dangerous.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yeah.
I, too, need[Pause=3] to acquire enough strength,
so I can fight properly by myself[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Then,[Pause=3] why not take some special training?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Good idea, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Can I ask you for a sparring match?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yeah, I don't mind.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, excellent.[Pause=3]
Then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Here I come[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BIRAKU_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BIRAKU][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You left an opening[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Sound=SE_EVT_SWING1TIMES1][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight][EyeCommand=eh]Guh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're good, Sir Biraku.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]However[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Your footwork is faulty![FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BIRAKU][EyeCommand=ec][Sound=SE_EVT_DMG1]Uwah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]I win, I suppose.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Guh,[Pause=3] I've been beaten.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Your offence is satisfactory.[Pause=3]
However, you leave an opening after
attacking.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] that's why I lost.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Although, if[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hm?[Pause=3]
What is it? Please tell me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Were there somebody else attacking with
you, at the same time,[Pause=3] there might not be an
issue at all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right.[Pause=3]
Hit-and-run is the original style of Orleans.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah, I see.[Pause=3]
So that's where the strength of the
Wolfguard lies.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Bah, you saw through our tactics so easily.[Pause=3]
I'm amazed.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, if I were to take two such attacks
at once[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I don't know how I'd survive.[A][ClearBox]But, more importantly[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I realized something, now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Biraku, you should be able to[Pause=3] perform 
better in battle by charging with your
comrades, instead of taking the vanguard.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]So, you mean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yeah.[Pause=3]
I already know what's the topic of our
next training.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_BIRAKU_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight]Pant, pant[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
S-sir Biraku.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=BIRAKU][TargetRight]Hm?[Pause=3]
What is it, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39]?[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight][RemovePortrait][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ec]S-sorry, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I wonder if we could lower the pace a bit?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BIRAKU][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][Music=BGM_EVT_SINGEKI4]Oh yes, sorry.[Pause=3]
Let's do just that.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][EyeCommand=ed]I said you'd fare better, by charging
together with others, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] aren't you
moving a bit too fast?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Is that so?[A][ClearBox]We usually move at twice this speed
in the Wolfguard.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Twice[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That shouldn't be humanly possible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Anyway, it seems[Pause=3] I've no hope of
entering the Wolfguard.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Is that right[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
'Tis a pity.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_BIRAKU_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight]Sir Roshe[Pause=3] can keep up with your pace,
can't he?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yeah.[Pause=3]
Roshe, Wolf, Zagaro[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
We've always been together.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ec]And Coyote too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]About Emperor Hardin[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ed]It's alright, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Our cause isn't mistaken.[Pause=3]
Is that not true?[A][ClearBox]I believe in your cause.[Pause=3]
That's why I'm here with you, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Biraku[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes, believe it.[Pause=3]
Prince Marth is a man you can trust.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ELREAN_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]So you're [SpecialText0x14=0x39], huh?[Pause=3]
Hmph, you don't look like that great
of a man.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Ellerean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]How did you come to know about me?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Marich was talking[Pause=3] about you, earlier.[Pause=3]
As a reliable knight who sticks to
the prince.[A][ClearBox]Heh, I really shouldn't expect much
from what Marich says.[A][ClearBox]I can tell hard times are ahead[Pause=3]
if we have to rely on someone like you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Indeed.[Pause=3]
I'm still much in need of further training.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]What?[Pause=3]
So you admit your weakness?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.
I have no choice but to become much stronger.[Pause=3]
For Prince Marth's sake.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]For somebody else's sake, huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Heh, sounds just like something Marich
would say.[A][ClearBox]However, I won't lose to somebody like you.[Pause=3]
I have no intention of falling behind
in battle.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ELREAN_B
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][Sound=SE_EVT_SWING3TIMES2]Hah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] Hah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] Haah[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN][TargetLeft][Music=BGM_EVT_DISGUST1]Hmph,[Pause=3] such primitive training.[Pause=3]
Is that how you train back in Aritia?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Ellerean.[Pause=3]
No, this is how I train by myself.[A][ClearBox]During the Aritian knights' training,
we learned the importance of co-operation
between comrades, after all.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Comrades?[Pause=3]
How foolish.[Pause=3]
Sounds like something Marich would say.[A][ClearBox]You can't become stronger while being
so friendly.[A][ClearBox]Those who are learning alongside you
aren't your comrades.[Pause=3]
They're enemies, all of them.[A][ClearBox]That's why[Pause=3] I warned Marich time and
time again that he shouldn't think so
naively, yet[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You sure think about Sir Marich a lot,
don't you?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]A-absurd[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why would I ever need to think about
Marich?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But when we're talking, you're always
"Marich this" and "Marich that"[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]S-shut up.[Pause=3]
I've never given a thought about him,
not even for a moment.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Hmph, you drive me mad.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Just like Marich[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]See, again.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]S-shut up[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
We're done here[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ELREAN_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ELREAN][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Hmph, [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
So you're still alive.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Ellerean,[Pause=3] I'm glad you're safe.[A][ClearBox]It's nice[Pause=3] that both of us comrades
are alive to chat like this.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Hmph, I have no comrades.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]You have no comrades, huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Was it like that back when you were
in the School of Khadein, as well?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]Of course.[Pause=3]
I was different from those fools
around me, after all.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]They kept their distance from me[Pause=3] and I
laughed scornfully at them in response.[Pause=3]
I've always been alone.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]But, that's right[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That guy, Marich, was different.[A][ClearBox]He said he wanted[Pause=3] to be my friend.[Pause=3]
No matter how often I ignored him[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]How stupid.[Pause=3]
Everyone hated me,[Pause=3] and I talked behind
everyone's backs[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]And yet[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why did he want to be my friend[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ellerean[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I see, Sir Marich was a precious friend
to you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But, there was just an unfortunate
estrangement.[Pause=3]
Actually, you and Sir Marich[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_ELREAN_A_2
[TargetLeft]D-don't be absurd.[Pause=3]
I don't care about Marich[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Hmph, being with you really makes my
blood boil.[Pause=3]
I'm heading back[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Sure, but come back when you feel like it.[Pause=3]
And[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I want to become your friend, too.[Pause=3]
That's what I wish.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Even in that aspect you're like Marich.[A][ClearBox]Hmph, you guys piss me off[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=FROST][EyeCommand=eh][LoadBackground=BBG75]"I am in good health."[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]No, no, no.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER]Sir Frost.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]"Your grandfather is doing well."[Pause=3]
[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Not quite.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sir Frost, watch out[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
There's a wall ahead[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ed]Yowie[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

May I ask what you were doing?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Take a look.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Is this a letter?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed.[A][ClearBox]I was writing a letter[Pause=3] to my family.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I see.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec]It's nice to have a family.[A]
Unfortunately, I can't really think of
anything good to write.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ed]Oh right, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3]
Might you have any good ideas?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I've never[Pause=3] had the fortune of
receiving letters from my family.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh my gosh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]![A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]However,[Pause=3] if I were to receive a letter
from my grandfather now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hm?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I think he'd want me to write about[Pause=3]
the things that are happening now.[A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=ec]Like how I'm thinking about a good start,[Pause=3]
but am stuck with what to write.[A]
[EyeCommand=ed]I think that would be good enough.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Ooh[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
That might be good enough, indeed.[A]
Then, without further ado[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][EyeCommand=eh]"I am obtaining assistance from a[Pause=3]

I can only hope she's safe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Please don't push yourself.[Pause=3]

Prince Marth has the talent of uniting
everyone's hearts as one.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes,[Pause=3] Misheil recognized that as well.[Pause=3]
That Prince Marth has the qualifications
of a hero[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Somebody like him[Pause=3] might very well be suited
to be king.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, I think so as well.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I'm envious of him.[A][ClearBox]The ideal kingdom,
where everyone can live in equality[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]

Princess Minerva, you are very charming
yourself.[A][ClearBox]Having fought by your side,[Pause=3] I know you

You're actually very kind and gentle.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I don't deserve those words.[Pause=3]
I'm not that great of a person.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]But,[Pause=3] it doesn't feel bad[Pause=3]

I must polish my bow skills more and more
so I can repay my debt[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You're really obstinate aren't you, Thomas[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh well, if you're going to train now anyway,[Pause=3]

This is a fried apple.[A][ClearBox]You remove the apple's core,[Pause=3]
add butter and sugar and fry it.[A][ClearBox]We used to fry and eat old apples like

What's wrong? Can't I call you that? [A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Well, it sounds, um, odd don't you think?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]But,[Pause=3] Mar-Mar didn't say anything![A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Besides, Mar-Mar and Tar-Tar go together
really well![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]If Prince Marth doesn't mind, then I
suppose I've no reason to complain[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But where did "Tar-Tar" come from[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I dunno.[Pause=3] It just sounded right![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Okay, you've seriously lost me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Couldn't you call me something else?[Pause=3]
Say, for instance[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]"Unkie [SpecialText0x14=0x39]"?
Like[Pause=3] Ban-Ban?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, no, that wouldn't work.[Pause=3]
I'm not that old.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Then, how about "Lord [SpecialText0x14=0x39]"?[Pause=3]
Just like Lord Gato?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] no. No way.[Pause=3]
I'm not a noble or anyone nearly that
important[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oh, alright, "Tar-Tar" will have to do,
I guess.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Okay, Tar-Tar[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

Looks like I've no choice in the matter.[A][ClearBox]Let me think[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Hmm, let's try this.[Pause=3]
Once upon a time, in a distant land[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Oh, that reminds me,[Pause=3] that happened a long
time ago too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Huh?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Once upon a time[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Back when I still lived with my grandfather[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]A little girl appeared in our village
all of a sudden.[A][ClearBox]She was very cheerful and cute,[Pause=3]
like, yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] like you, Chiki.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Then? Then?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]That time, there were bad bandits nearby
who attacked the village.[A][ClearBox]An old man in the village decided to protect
the village from the bandits.[A][ClearBox]But the old man was, of course, already old[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Chances were he would be defeated
by the bandits.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_TIKI_A_2
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft]Yes, yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The old man's grandson[Pause=3] disobeyed his
order and chased after him.[A][ClearBox]Even if he was[Pause=3] unable to,[Pause=3] that boy wanted
to protect his grandfather.[A][ClearBox]However, when he tried to enter the
bandits' hideout[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]The hideout had completely disappeared,[Pause=3]
as if blown away by a fierce storm.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][EyeCommand=ec][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Yes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Hm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The bandits fled from there somehow,[Pause=3]
but were soon captured by the knights.[A][ClearBox]And everyone lived happily ever after[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
But,[Pause=3] the girl had disappeared.[A][ClearBox]The villagers were left puzzled[Pause=3] by the
bizarre situation.[A][ClearBox]But the religious elders[Pause=3] claimed it was
Lord Narga's guidance.[Pause=3]
It was as if[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Zzz[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]zzz[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]As if[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Chiki?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Zzz[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]zzz[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Did you fall asleep?[Pause=3]

You'll catch a cold if you sleep here.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yesz[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]zzz[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Tar[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]I have no other option, huh[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]It'd be a pity to wake her up.[Pause=3]
I guess I'll carry her on my back.[A][ClearBox]Here Chiki, let's go.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yesz[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

I'm talking about the food.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The food.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indeed.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]The speed, quantity,[Pause=3] order of the dishes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
There was nothing I could criticize[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-I see.[A][ClearBox]I suppose it's because, when it came to
food, my grandfather taught me strictly.[A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]However.[A]
Even so, the quantity you're eating is
clearly excessive.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What are you talking about[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]A knight must fight, as a shield to
his people.[A][ClearBox]For that purpose, what's more important than
building your body[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
Can you answer that?[Pause=3] Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I know what you mean.[Pause=3]

Say, you want some?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, thanks.[Pause=3]
But anyway,[Pause=3] can you really eat that much?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, and I will[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I MUST eat[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[Pause=3] Wait a minute.[A][ClearBox]Are you forcing[Pause=3] yourself to eat this much?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]Do you remember[Pause=3] what I told you earlier
about what being a knight entails?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[A][ClearBox]Being a shield to his people.[Pause=3]
For that purpose, a strong body is needed,
right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right.[A]
But, can you answer me this?[Pause=3]
What does being a shield mean?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]When the time comes,[Pause=3] you stand in the front,
protect the people,[Pause=3] and defeat the enemy.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes.[Pause=3]
Good answer.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]But, that's a sword.[Pause=3]
Not a shield.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[Pause=3]
Well, I suppose.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]There was one time[Pause=3] when I stood
in the battlefield unarmed.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Wha[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=TOMS][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]Sir Tomth.[Pause=3]
I see you're eating again, today.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Why don't you join me?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes,[Pause=3] I will.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You didn't complain[Pause=3] about this meal, today.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]On that subject,[Pause=3] I want to hear the rest
of our previous conversation.[A][ClearBox]Then story of when[Pause=3] you stood unarmed
in the battlefield, Sir Tomth.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Okay.[Pause=3]
Then, listen while we eat.[A][ClearBox]I was[Pause=3] member of a small platoon,
which had been captured by the enemy.[A][ClearBox]Shortly afterwards,[Pause=3] we heard that
somebody had come to rescue us.[A]
It was Prince Marth.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]But, at the same time,[Pause=3] our executions had
started, too.[A][ClearBox]Among us, there was an archer and
a bishop.[A][ClearBox]I couldn't let a single arrow reach them.[A][ClearBox]But,[Pause=3] with only one body, you can only protect
one ally from one foe.[A]
It's simple as that.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] 
Yes, indeed.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thankfully,[Pause=3] there was another man in the
platoon who could be a shield with me.[A]
Thanks to that, we were all saved.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]All of you?[Pause=3] 
That's amazing[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]But that's only[Pause=3] because Prince Marth
came early.[A][ClearBox]Had he came a little later, who knows what
would have happened.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that's why[Pause=3] a strong body is important.[Pause=3]
I understand now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MBTK_TOMS_A_2
Currently, there are many people in our army
who excel at offense.[A][ClearBox]That's exactly why I can focus on defending.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Thanks, Sir Tomth.[A][ClearBox]When this war is over, I want to eat with
you again.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Yes[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I'll gladly accept your challenge for an
eating contest[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]I didn't say anything about an
eating contest.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ZAGARO_C
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ZAGARO][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Swords[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Good.[A][ClearBox]Bows[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Good.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]Sir Zagaro.[Pause=3] What are you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Wow.[A][ClearBox]What are you doing?[Pause=3]
Why are you arranging weapons like this?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39], was it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Spear and horse tack,[Pause=3] and even spellbooks[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I'm doing their maintenance.[Pause=3]
Sorry for taking up space.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, I don't mind.[A][ClearBox]But, it seems[Pause=3] you've even got weapons[Pause=3]
you have no use for, Sir Zagaro.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, indeed.[A][ClearBox]But, they might be needed[Pause=3] in the next battle.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That could very well be true, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I know what you mean.[A][ClearBox]I, too, would only do[Pause=3] maintenance on bows,[Pause=3]
until not too long ago.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is that so?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, that's how it usually is.[Pause=3]
Well, next up is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Staves[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Good, I'm done.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]Well, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3] If you'll excuse me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Okay.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ZAGARO_B
[SpecialText0x14][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ZAGARO][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetLeft]Axes[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Good.[A][ClearBox]Meh, this sword[Pause=3] is in need of repair.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetRight]Sir Zagaro.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Oh, Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]Sorry for taking up so much space[Pause=3] always.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, it's fine.[A][ClearBox]Can I take a look[Pause=3] at this horse tack?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yes, go ahead.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]This was[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] very meticulously done.[A][ClearBox]Did you do all of this, Sir Zagaro?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That's right.[A][ClearBox]Well, I wasn't the one supposed to use it
at first, but[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm?[Pause=3] Then, who?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Wolf.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Ah,[Pause=3] the Wolfguard's leader[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] right?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]He's[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] in one word, a genius.[A][ClearBox]I got his bow and tack ready,[Pause=3] and he fired.[Pause=3]
At first, that was how we operated.[A][ClearBox]But, in the previous war,[Pause=3] he got more and
more stronger[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]And came to use[Pause=3] weapons other than bows?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Precisely.[Pause=3] Depending on the strategy,
he changed the weapons he used.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]That's amazing.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]And, to match his pace[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I ended up getting[Pause=3] used to repairing
all kinds of weapons.[A][ClearBox][X]

MBTK_ZAGARO_A
[SpecialText0x14][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ZAGARO][LoadBackground=BBG75][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Sir Zagaro.[Pause=3] Weapon maintenance again?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Oh, if it isn't Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[A][ClearBox]You came at a good time.[Pause=3]
Could you swing[Pause=3] this lance for a moment?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes, got it.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][Sound=SE_EVT_SWING2TIMES1][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]How is it?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]After I swing it, it feels like the tip
stretches a little[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I think.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]What[FreezeMouth]!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Give it to me.[A][ClearBox]Hm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Oh, this.[A][ClearBox]Indeed, even thought it's tiny,[Pause=3]
a needless gap appears between the
handle and the spearhead.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Hm, is that so?[Pause=3]
I don't really know, see.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I felt there was something wrong with it,[Pause=3]
but I couldn't figure out the cause.[A][ClearBox]But you found it with a single swing.[Pause=3]
I'm impressed.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I-is that so?[Pause=3]
I'm not very knowledgeable, though.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73]It was probably because I used to do 
plenty of maintenance on my[Pause=3] grandfather's
training weapons.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see.[Pause=3] So your body has memorized
the ideal weapon conditions?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Sir [SpecialText0x14=0x39].[Pause=3] Could I ask you to check the
maintenance of other weapons?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Sure, why not.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]I'm grateful.[A][ClearBox]Then, without delay[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Could you swing
this staff and axe at the same time[Pause=3]
and tell me how they are?[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F16][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Huh?[Pause=3]
No, nobody can do that.[A][ClearBox][X]
