[SpecialText0x14][Fade=40][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG69][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][TargetRight]What is this strange air?
It feels like it's full of evil spirits.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That is true...
My body appears to be frozen.[A][ClearBox]These are the evil spirits of the
Earth Dragons. Your highness, it seems
we can't have everybody enter ahead.[A][ClearBox]Since we don't know what
will happen, please choose carefully
who to take with you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I hope to at least take the people
who are worried about the four sisters.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Mmm... There's no avoiding that.
But how many people will survive?
I bet this will be a fierce battle.[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG69][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=GATO]Prince Marth, in this altar lurks many
savage barbarians and demon dragons
long gone mad.[A][ClearBox]They have fallen under Garnef's spell
and will attack you given the chance.[A][ClearBox]Garnef's servants[SpecialSymbol=0x96]
the heretic priests possess great power.
They are not to be taken lightly.[A][ClearBox]If you let this battle drag on,
it may become fiercer than you can handle.[Pause=3]
Do not stop. Make for the end at once[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Once you defeat Garnef, retrieve the
Falchion that he stole from your Aritia.[A][ClearBox]As you well know, without the Falchion,
defeating Mediuth will be nigh impossible[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I understand, Lord Gato.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]My friends and I shall sally forth
to the deepest depths of the altar[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]It would be wise to bring this ally with you.[Pause=3]
She has deigned to lend you her strength.[A][ClearBox]
