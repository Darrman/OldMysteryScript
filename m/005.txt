The[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] A-Aritian army has arrived[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]You moron.[Pause=3] Why are you so panicked?[Pause=3]

that might besmirch our name.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Captain George[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Anyway,[Pause=3] inform everyone:[Pause=3]
