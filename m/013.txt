[Unknown0x12]2[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CHEINE][LoadBackground=BBG33][TargetRight]Are we there yet, Chainy?
We've climbed so high already.[A][ClearBox]It's freezing and[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
It's becoming increasingly difficult to
breathe[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Just hang on a bit longer, princey.[A][ClearBox]Look, you can see it, right?
That's the Ice Dragons' Temple over there.
Where Gato's waitin' for you.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You know, I must admit, I was shocked when
you told me that Chiki was the daughter of
the Divine Dragon King.[A][ClearBox]And that you and Gato were both divine
dragons.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Oh, yeah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] When the Divine Dragons fought the
Earth Dragons they wore out their dragon
stones, and so practically became extinct.[A][ClearBox]Aside from Narga, only Gato, me and the
newborn Chiki survived.[A][ClearBox]Y'see, after the war, Gato
and I threw away our dragon stones.[Pause=3]
So, I can never be a dragon again.[A][ClearBox]Even so, I still have knowledge and power
that exceeds that of humans.[A][ClearBox]Sure, Gato still stands by Narga's command
and watches out for humans[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But that ain't my thing.[A][ClearBox]Y'see, I don't like humans.[A][ClearBox]I've got nothin' but contempt for those
who treated the defenseless Mamkutes like
insects.[A][ClearBox]So I can understand why Mediuth despised
you humans so.[A][ClearBox]Mediuth, an Earth Dragon prince, tricked
his own tribe and he alone became a Mamkute.[A][ClearBox]And, as ordered by Narga, he guarded the
Dragon's Altar.[A][ClearBox]But the once peaceful human race, drunk
with power, began to rule with tyranny.[A][ClearBox]They oppressed the dragons who had done
nothin' wrong.[A][ClearBox]Furious at their betrayal by humans,
the Mamkutes gathered in Durhua,[A][ClearBox]and they created a nation for their people.
Then they fought to conquer humanity.[A][ClearBox]To save the humans, Gato gave them the
divine sword Falchion.[A][ClearBox]He established an academy in Khadein,
and began to teach magic.[A][ClearBox]Me? I was just an onlooker.[Pause=3]
Winner or loser, it was no concern of mine.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But then, why help me?[Pause=3]
I too am human[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]You're different.[Pause=3]
You don't seem like an unreliable
person either[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Mmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Thanks, Chainy.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Oh, look at me.[Pause=3]
I'm blushin'.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61]Anyway, let's head to the shrine.
But watch out for the ice dragons.[A][ClearBox]Even though they've lost their minds,
they still protect the shrine instinctively.[Pause=3]
The poor creatures[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

[Unknown0x12]2[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BECK][LoadBackground=][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetRight]You, you're Beck[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
To think we'd meet here of all places[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Me too, Prince Marth.
Boy am I surprised to see you.[Pause=3]
It's been far too long.[A][ClearBox]After the war, I was travelin' the continent.[Pause=3]
And, um, somehow[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You landed up here?[Pause=3]
Well, thank goodness. There's no way you
would have joined the barbarians.[A][ClearBox]Beck, we're fighting another war.
Why don't you come with us?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I don't have my ballista any more.[Pause=3]
Just my horse-buddy right 'ere.[A][ClearBox]But if you're fine with that, then sure.
I'll help you princey.[A][ClearBox][X]

MS013_ED1
[Unknown0x12]2[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG56][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=CHEINE][TargetRight]There's something that's been bothering me.[A][ClearBox]The five orbs are very important, correct?
But Lord Gato never told us much about
them.[A][ClearBox]Do you know anything about them, Chainy?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Well, Gato kept his lips shut 'cause he was
afraid of givin' you a heart attack.[A][ClearBox]Tell you what, I'll tell you about 'em.
But I have to warn you, you might be
better off not knowing...[A][ClearBox]The orbs are meant for the shield that binds
the earth dragons[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]In other words, they were once embedded in
the shield itself.[A][ClearBox]The orbs have been handed down for
generations amongst the divine dragons
and each contains a hidden power.[A][ClearBox]The shield itself is but a pedestal for the
five orbs to release their innate powers.[A][ClearBox]If even one orb is missing, the seal's a goner.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[Pause=3]
But if that's the case, why were the orbs
separated?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]'Cause the shield broke.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]The Shield of Seals that was enshrined in the
Raman Temple was stolen[FreezeMouth].[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]When exactly did this happen?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Six hundred years ago, I reckon.[Pause=3]
Gato scoured the lands searchin' for the
shield, hopin' to get it back.[A][ClearBox]He managed to retrieve the five orbs,
but in the end, he couldn't find the shield.[A][ClearBox]Then, in the last war[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]The Raman Temple was looted and the orbs
were scattered once more.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see[FreezeMouth].[UnfreezeMouth]
So the orbs that Lord Gato lost[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
He's searching for them again?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Yep. I'm sure you know about the Star Orb,
Light Orb and Earth Orb[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]But there's also the Dark Orb and
Life Orb.[A][ClearBox]Gato's got the Light Orb,[Pause=3] but the
Star Orb's in pieces,[A][ClearBox]and it sounds like Garnef gave the
Dark Orb to Hardin.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]The Earth Orb is in Aritia, so all that remains
is the Life Orb.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Anyway, let's go inside.[Pause=3]
I'll be helpin' you too.[Pause=3]
Now, come on, princey[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]

MS013_ED2
[SpecialText0x14][Unknown0x12]2[Fade=40][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][LoadBackground=BBG56]Sire, please wait.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER][TargetLeft][SpecialText0x14=0x39], you as well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft]I just received a distressing message.[Pause=3]
People have been sighted not far behind us.[A][ClearBox]There seems to be a battle underway.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Out here[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Could it be the barbarians?
Or perhaps it's the assassins[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]In any case, this area is almost entirely
uninhabited. So it can't be any old people[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]To make matters worse, the snow is becoming
heavier[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] Fighting will be difficult in this
weather.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]But if there are allies[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=PLAYER]Indeed. We cannot abandon them.
If there are allies that is[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]
[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MS013_ED2_Y
[TargetRight]Then we'll just have to find out for ourselves,
before the battle is over.[Pause=3] Let's go[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]
