PROLOGUE:
Eliminated. No need to revise it!
(Clobber some scenes in Prologue 1 and put Tapestry and Mystery of the Emblem cutscenes in their place.)

CHAPTER 1:
MTUTS_TRANSPORTER, ...R:
Removed

OP1: (Lang introduces himself)
No changes

OP1_02: (Jeigan explains the situation)
Severely cut down from FE3
Partially moved to "Expeditionary Forces" base convo in FE12, but details about Lang are gone

OP1_03A: Kris variant, replace with non-Kris variant... which is just the final line of FE3's intro

EV0:
Not in FE3, but not Kris, retain

EV1: (Lawrence and Oguma event)
Implication that Lang will kill the twins restored

TK1: (Lawrence blows up)
No changes. Restoring the explosion is beyond me.

Houses aren't a priority. The 1st of April is dangerously close.

VIL1: (Recruiting Malliesia)
No changes. I won't kill Malliesia's third person talk, it's in the original.

ED0:
Not in the original. Retaining.

ED1: (You find the twins)
Lang killing the kids removed again, Yumina no longer threatens suicide, pointless Kris interjection, Marth doesn't explicitly go to Macedonia for Minerva's sake anymore

ED1_02: (And Lang runs off with them)
No changes, Lang still takes the kids away

_03: Kris interjection removed

CHAPTER 2:

MS002_OP0:
Additional Kris scene; cutting

MTUTS_FE24
I won't disable How's Everyone (I don't know how) but I'll cut its tutorial

OP1: (Katua flies in)
No change

I know one house got changed because the boss doesn't have a knight killer in FE12 anymore

TK1: (Recruiting Warren)
No change

ED1: (Linda gives you the FE)
Shut up Kris, FE12 weakens implications of Linda wandering around alone

VIL1:
Not in the original game. Don't care enough to re-cut the removed characters. 

CHAPTER 3:

MS003_OP0:
Kris scene, removing

OP1: (Rena's disappeared)
Julian doesn't tell Paola he can't help save Maria anymore

EV1: (Misheil's alive)
Ryuke suggests Minerva is merely dying instead of dead

VIL1: (Recruiting Julian)
No change

VIL2: (Silver Axe)
Completely replaced, Silver Axe becomes an axe guy

VIL3:
A textless hidden event in the original

TK1: (Recruiting Machis)
No change

ED1:
Jeigan doesn't call Lang nonsensical anymore

ED2: (Jeigan's finest hour)
Kris butts in and steals the limelight, scene flow in general gets muddled. Kris motivates Marth when he opens his gob instead of Marth taking the initiave when the twins are safe
They did program a non-Kris version, but it uses Kris anyway
ED2_02:
More reshuffling of line positions, most removed lines are unimportant, most important loss is that Marth doesn't resolve to save the twins anymore, even if it involves fighting Lang

ED3: (Lang's run off now)
Jeigan doesn't jab Lang as much, Kris steals a line from him here too, Marth doesn't care about Minerva anymore

ED4:
Not in the original game, a gaiden entry. I'll leave Kris intact for gaiden related stuff. Interestingly there's a yes to gaiden option, so maybe they could be declined at some point...

CHAPTER 4:

Hair lines, severely truncated to avoid anything breaking

No changes.

EV0:
Reinforcement warning, retained.

EV1: (George gets his orders)
Moved from Turn 2 Enemy Phase to chapter opening, no dialogue changes

TK1: (Recruiting Ricardo)

ED1: (Wendel got locked up here)
Lang's motivation for imprisoning him changed: he was conscripted into dealing with the Grunians in FE3, while he's accused of collaborating with them in the remake. Info on the state of Khadein also disappeared. Wendel no longer directly asks Marth to find the Star Shards.

ED2:
Kris gets a pope hat, truncated to avoid issues.

CHAPTER 8:
MS008_OP0:
Kris scene, removed.

OP1: (Kain rides in)
Kris line removed

EV1: (Time's up, Hardin's moving)
No change.

EV2:
Not in the original, more foreboding for Hardin's first appearance

TK2:
Not in the original, Marth can recruit George as well in the remake.

TK3:
Not in the original, Sheeda recruits Roger here.

VIL1: (Banutu lost his stone again)
No change.

ED1:
FE12 makes Kris the hero here. Not on my watch, he isn't.

ED2:

CHAPTER 9:

MS009_OP0:

ED1: (Into Khadein temple we go)
Marth isn't concerned about Marich anymore

CHAPTER 10:
MS010_OP0:
Kris scene, you know the drill.

OP1: (Excalibur versus Thoron)

Ellerean no longer accuses Marich of getting Excalibur just because he's a noble, Marich no longer apologises to him and no longer says he's Wendel's only possible successor, Ellerean accuses Aritia of invading Akaneia instead of being punished for rebelling

EV1:
Not in the original, hint for the Silver Card

TK1: (Wendel snaps Ellerean out of it)
Wendel no longer mentions Garnef was a good man once, doesn't rhetorically ask if Ellerean follows in Garnef's footsteps anymore

ED1: (Your next mission: Anri's Way)
Marth somehow summoned Gato originally, Marth doesn't ask why Hardin's invincible, positive aspects of the Dark Orb stripped away, FE12 has the Dark Orb go with instead of against the Light Orb, Marth no longer considers Hardin strong-willed, Anri isn't mentioned as the sole human to clear Anri's Way

ED2:
Not in the original, Silver Card just appears in the original. Jeigan says the line instead.

CHAPTER 11:
Here starts Anri's Way, that which was horrendeously mutilated in the remake...

Kris scene, begone.

OP1: (Oh, what did FE12 do to you?)

No change. Somehow.

TK1:
Not in the original, recruiting Daros.

ED1: (Gato's actually a dragon!)
The fate of the Demon and Flying Dragons is no longer stated, Earth Dragon description severly cut down, FE3 implies Narga had 5000 more years to live but that could be a mistranslation?

ED2: Chainy complaining about the heat becomes Jeigan instead in a Kris scene.

ED_BS:
More random BSFE guys not in the original!

CHAPTER 13:

MS013_OP0
Kris. Line. Gone.

OP1: (Why Mediuth fought the humans)
No longer mentioned that the Divine Dragons are all but extinct, Mediuth no longer fooled the rest of his tribe, Marth goes from reliable to flaky

Not in the original, gaiden entry.
