Macedonia? Or Durhua?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Both[SpecialSymbol=0x96]we are precisely on the border.[Pause=3]
I hear this place is home to Macedonia's
great wyverns.[A][ClearBox]But since the area is overrun with
barbarians,[A][ClearBox]even the Macedonian soldiers dare not
set foot in here.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I see.[Pause=3]
So this is the Dragon's Dale.

Am I being scolded now[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Brother, listen to me[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]

I stole it from him, but not without cost[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Garnef, you say[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Where is he now?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]At the Dragon's Altar[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x73][EyeCommand=ec]Heh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] how pathetic[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]

would fall foul[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] to Garnef?[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x61][EyeCommand=ed]Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Please[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
I am not long for this world.

MS021_ED1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG69][TargetRight]So this is the Dragon's Altar.
The place where divine dragon Narga
banished the earth dragons[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]But, wasn't Mediuth the guardian of the altar?[A][ClearBox]
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=GATO]Indeed.[Pause=3] Mediuth could not tolerate the human
race's atrocities against the Mamkutes.[A][ClearBox]Thus, he gathered the surviving dragonkin,
forming the Durhuan Empire.[A][ClearBox]All to obliterate mankind.[A][ClearBox]He was vanquished by Anri once and
then defeated a second time by you.[A][ClearBox]However earth dragons boast tremendous
life force, and cannot be completely
eliminated so easily[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Even now, they sleep at this altar.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You mean to say they'll awaken[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Not exactly. Even sleeping earth dragons
should not awaken for centuries or so.[A][ClearBox]Mediuth is now changing his form.
The next time he awakens though,
he will rise as a terrifying Dark Dragon[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]No, wait[FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth] Perhaps[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth]
Yes, I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
So that's why Garnef[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What's the matter, Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Prince Marth.[Pause=3]
I have finally realized the reason
why Garnef kidnapped the clerics.[A][ClearBox]He intends to use them to resurrect Mediuth.[A][ClearBox]To hasten the awakening of a dragon
requires the life force of
pure, maiden women.[A][ClearBox]Knowing this, Garnef kidnapped them.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So that means Ellis and the
others are in this very altar?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Indubitably[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Marth, you must hurry.
They are in grave danger![A][ClearBox]Mediuth's awakening[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
is only a matter of time[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]

Too bad. But, oh well.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I'm sorry.[Pause=3]
After you went to all that trouble too[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]It's fine, it's fine.[Pause=3]

Why here[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I[SpecialSymbol=0x96]I never wanted to fight you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I just wanted things to be like
they used to[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
With you and Maria[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Brother[FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth] Misheil[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Bro[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]ther[FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][Pause=6][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Your tears[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Minerva. I'd be an endless laughing stock.[A][ClearBox]The Misheil you knew[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
would never die in a place like this.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]Am I right?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Brother[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] Oh, Brother[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x73]Hmph, don't get the wrong idea.[Pause=3]
You and I are still enemies[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
That will not change.[A][ClearBox]The incompetence of your army sickens me,
so you leave me with no choice but to help.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Thank goodness[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You've finally returned to your old self.[A][ClearBox]I understand.[Pause=3]
Until the Dark Dragon breathes his last,
let us borrow your strength.[A][ClearBox][Unknown0x4=F][X]
