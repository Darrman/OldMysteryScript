We have no liege.[A][ClearBox]I need gold,[Pause=3] and will do anything for it.[Pause=3]

I'm sure we could save her.[A][ClearBox]Alright, let's do it, Caesar![A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Raddy, there's no need for you to follow me.[A][ClearBox]My sister is my business.[Pause=3]
The Aritian army is strong.[Pause=3]

Marth's allies in the previous war.[Pause=3]
I do wonder if they'll be of any use.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]So what?[Pause=3] Doesn't matter.
If they're useless, all I have to do is kill him
myself.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Bah, I don't like you getting the best part.[Pause=3]

previous war.[Pause=3] You're both my comrades.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Prince, forgive me, but we're mercenaries.[Pause=3]
All we did in the previous war was fulfill our
duties as hired swords.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It might have been just a job for you two[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
But not to me.[A][ClearBox]Both of you are my precious comrades.[Pause=3]
You were then, and still are now.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Prince[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I appreciate your willingness to say such kind
words to mercenaries like us.[A][ClearBox]However, at the end of the day, we're hired
swords.[Pause=3] Therefore, we ask for gold.[A][ClearBox]Prince, Akaneia occupies your country.[Pause=3]
It's obvious you don't have the extra
resources needed to pay us.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Well, you have a point[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]
[FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=PLAYER]Gold shouldn't be an issue.[A][ClearBox]Prince Marth will reclaim Aritia, our homeland.[A][ClearBox]Aritia may be occupied by Akaneia now,
but we shall defeat them.[Pause=3]
And then, you'll have the gold you seek.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Do you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] honestly think you stand a chance?[Pause=3]
Against a powerful kingdom like Akaneia?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Of course.[Pause=3]
Besides, I'm sure you don't have a choice,
at this point.[A][ClearBox]Since you've failed your mission, Akaneia
won't pay you the gold you seek anymore.[A][ClearBox]If you're a hired sword working for gold,
following Prince Marth would serve your
interests better.[Pause=3] Am I wrong?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Indeed, your argument is sound.[Pause=3]
As we've failed, we have no other options.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft]Prince Marth, Raddy and I are now your
hired swords.[A][ClearBox]We shall accompany you for as long as you
wish us to.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Thank you, Caesar.[A][ClearBox][Fade=40][Unknown0x4=F][X]

we have there.[A][ClearBox]Aritia may be occupied by Akaneia now,
but we shall defeat them.[Pause=3]
And then, you'll have the gold you seek.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Do you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] honestly think you stand a chance?[Pause=3]
Against a powerful kingdom like Akaneia?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Yes.[Pause=3]
Prince Marth shall be the victor.[Pause=3]
We won't be defeated.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]You're an odd man.[A][ClearBox]It seems you have the power to move the
hearts of others, just like Prince Marth
does.[A][ClearBox]Even if it seems an impossible task,
you might just be the man to pull it off[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
That's how you make me feel.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Since you've failed your mission, Akaneia
won't pay you the gold you seek anymore.[A][ClearBox]If you're a hired sword working for gold,
following Prince Marth would serve your
interests better.[Pause=3] Am I wrong?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]Fair enough.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft]Prince Marth, Raddy and I are now your

Now that Raddy's been killed[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]That's right, Raddy is dead[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
We killed him.[Pause=3] But that's exactly why I'm
