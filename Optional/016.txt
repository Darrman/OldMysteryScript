[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG01]How disgraceful[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Thieves inside our fair castle?[A][ClearBox]What if they've stolen the Earth Orb[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN]Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking
thief making his way north.[Pause=3]

inside, so what should we do...[A][ClearBox][X]

[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=JORJUE][LoadBackground=][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ASTRIA][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Astria![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Well, if it isn't the turncoat, George.[Pause=3]
What form of death would you prefer?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]H-hold your sword, Astria.[Pause=3] General Eibel
has already fallen. Even if you fight
here, you've no chance of winning.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]You would have me surrender[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Never[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth] Though I may be the last

I am a soldier of Akaneia[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x61]Why do you fight[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth]
For whom?
Emperor Hardin?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I think not[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
Not for him.[A][ClearBox]For Princess Nina[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
For Akaneia[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Then tell me, was it Princess Nina
who ordered you to arms?[A][ClearBox]Do you honestly believe that Princess
Nina would wish for a war like this?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]She[FreezeMouth]...![UnfreezeMouth]
I have not seen the princess in some time.[A][ClearBox]She has been ill of late.[A][ClearBox]Hardin is the ruler of Akaneia and my liege.
I've no choice but to obey.[A][ClearBox]If I do not, then I betray Akaneia.[Pause=3]
And I betray Princess Nina.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Astria, Princess Nina entrusted Marth
with the Fire Emblem.[A][ClearBox]Do you understand what that entails?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]C-come again[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What are you trying to tell me, George?[A][ClearBox]Are you suggesting that Princess
Nina asked Prince Marth for help?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Is there any other reason?[A][ClearBox]Come with us, Astria.
See the truth with your own eyes.[A][ClearBox]If you die here, how would Midia feel?[A][ClearBox]Live, Astria, for her.[Pause=3]
Live, and face the truth of what
has come to pass.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I suppose it is unavoidable.[Pause=3]
But, George[SpecialSymbol=0x96][A][ClearBox]Should I learn that this war is a
product of Marth's ambition,
as Emperor Hardin claims[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Heads will roll[FreezeMouth].[UnfreezeMouth]
Am I clear[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

want their greasy hands on the loot.[A][ClearBox]While they're busy trying to unload
the chests, we will take that chance

Can you hear me?[A][ClearBox]I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings,
but it would seem that Princess Ellis
has been kidnapped by Garnef.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Lord Gato[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Do you speak truly[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I have found out that Garnef
commanded his priests to search for
clerics of noble birth.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][TargetLeft]It is most likely that Rena, Maria, and your
sister were spirited away by Garnef[FreezeMouth].[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]It can't be[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]What does he intend to do with them!?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]That, I do not know.[Pause=3]

Then I too shall go to Akaneia.[A][ClearBox]I still have to free Hardin from
the Dark Orb's influence.[A][ClearBox]I will defeat the Demon King
