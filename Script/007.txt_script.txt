*FINA enters**NABARL enters*
FINA:
Huff... huff...
Please... help me...
The thieves... They're going to... 

NABARL:
... 

FINA:
No, it can't be!
You're... one of them... as well? 
Oh, fine...
Do your worst!
If you're going to kill me, do it fast!! 

NABARL:
Girl... Get behind me. 
The Aritian army is marching towards the
south of this forest. I'll take you to them. 

FINA:
Huh? You're going to help me?
You mean, you're not with the thieves? 

NABARL:
Until just now, I was.
But, I've changed my mind. 

FINA:
Why...? 

NABARL:
There's someone in the Aritian army that I
want to see. That's all. 

FINA:
Hmmm...
But really, it's 'cause I'm cute, right? 


MS007_OP1_01:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
At any rate, I'm glad.
My name's Feena.
I'm a dancer from Warren. 
People say that once they see my dancing,
they feel instantly refreshed!
I can show you, if you like. 
Oh, I should tell you my story:
I got separated from my troupe,
and wandered into this forest. 
And then, those horrible thieves came
and tried to take me by force...
But it's okay now. 
You seem kind of scary, but actually you're
very kind. 
However, your appearance is...
Your face isn't bad, but your dress sense
is kind of lacking. 
And, ugh, what's with your hair?
You know, nowadays... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Just stop talking!
Anyway, don't stray too far. 
We'll cut our way to the west corner,
and then escape through there. 
If you want to live, then shut up and come
with me. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Ah... Y-yes, sorry... 


MS007_EV1:
*SOLDIER_RED enters**ASTRIA enters*
SOLDIER_RED:
Captain Astria, we've sighted the Aritian
army to the south! Shall we attack? 

ASTRIA:
Our mission is to hold this bridge.
Leaving the bridge will not be permitted.
Only attack if the enemy approaches. 

SOLDIER_RED:
Yes sir.
But what about the troops in the fort?
I hear they will march out soon. 

ASTRIA:
They were bought with coin by the Emperor:
Let them do as they please.
Either way, they won't win. 
WE will be the ones to stop the Aritian army. 


MS007_EV2:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, please exercise caution!
Reports indicate that a fire dragon has
emerged from the cave in the west! 


MS007_H1:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
The ones protecting the bridge are Astria's
free company: powerful men who stop at
nothing. 
As a wise man once said:
"Let sleeping dogs lie", eh? 


MS007_H2:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
The ancient Raman Temple is just a
treasure trove to thieves. 
You can see 'em carrying the stolen
treasure all over the place.
I hope they get cursed or something... 


MS007_H3:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
I wonder if you've seen that young lady's
dance? Marvelous, isn't it? 
Makes a tired body feel healthy again in the
blink of an eye! 


MS007_H4:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
You must never go near that cave. 
I heard a rumor that in that cave dwells a
terrible fire dragon. 


MS007_BT_ASTRIA:
*ASTRIA enters*
ASTRIA:
Traitors!
I'll show you the might of the Miracle!

Tryin' to take a cut from a thief's
plunderin'...
You people ain't even human!

Midia... My love... 


MS007_DIE_BOSS:
*DALL enters*
DALL:
Murderers... the lot of you...

*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we've driven away the thieves,
but the temple was completely ransacked;
anything that wasn't nailed down is gone. 

MARS:
Even Raman Temple has been reduced to ruins?
This is a frightful age we're in. 

JEIGUN:
I'm sure even Guardian God Narga would be
furious. 'Tis truly the end of civilization. 

MARS:
Jeigan, do you know the legend of Narga?
Can you tell me what you know of them? 

JEIGUN:
Yes; only vaguely, however.

MS007_ED1_2:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
It's said that a thousand years ago...
when there was not one king in the lands,
people lived in small villages. 
One day, terrible monsters descended
and the humans were massacred,
pushed to the brink of extinction. 
Only around 10,000 humans remained.
The few who survived prayed to the gods
for salvation. 
The gods heard their prayers, and a
gigantic warrior was sent down to earth. 
The warrior carried a gleaming blade of light
in his right hand, 
and in his left hand, a shield embedded with
five orbs. 
Then, after a fierce battle, he eradicated
the monsters and returned to the heavens. 
He was our guardian god, Narga,
and this temple is dedicated to him. 
"He was the avatar of the gods:
our guardian god..." 
Your highness, you should know that line
from the first chapter of the Raman Bible. 

MARS:
With the blade of light and the five orbs...
That is the legend of Narga... 



MS007_ED1_3_PCF1:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well then, sire.
We have to cross Cashmere Bridge soon. 
We must hurry; if the enemy takes it, getting
across will be nigh impossible. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Alright then, inform the whole army:
We cross Cashmere Bridge at once.
We haven't a moment to waste!
