*MARICH enters**ELREAN enters*
ELREAN:
Marich.
It's time to put an end to this. 

MARICH:
Wait, Ellerean!
Why do we have to fight? 
We were both Master Wendel's pupils:
we're friends, are we not?
Why do you despise me so? 

ELREAN:
I was Master Wendel's disciple before you,
and I was the stronger one. 
Even so, Master Wendel gave you Excalibur.
He should have given it to me! 
Why, Marich?
Is it because you're a noble of Aritia? 
Clearly, I was the only one worthy to be his
successor, yet he... 

MARICH:
Is that it? I'm sorry, Ellerean.
But I have no intention of succeeding
Master Wendel. 
I hold no ill feelings for Khadein, but once I
finish studying I plan to go home. 
Back in Aritia, there is somebody I must
protect for the rest of my life... 
That's why Master Wendel's successor
can only be you. 
So, Ellerean, please!
Why don't you join us so we can take back
Aritia? 

ELREAN:
Aritia, you say?! 
Why should we help a country that rebelled
against the empire and was invaded by them? 
The mage corps of Khadein have sworn
allegiance to Emperor Hardin. 
Oh, I see... I knew it was you...
YOU dragged the Aritian army here! 

MARICH:
No!!
That's not how it is! 

ELREAN:
Shut your mouth, traitor!!
I won't listen to your lies any longer! 
Your Excalibur and my Thoron;
we'll put them to the test! 


MS010_EV1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Everyone, we must rescue Marich!
However, the enemies include clerics who cannot fight. 
It would seem that they are being
threatened by the enemy. 
Please, try not to hurt them. 


MS010_TK1:
*WENDEL enters**ELREAN enters*
WENDEL:
Ellerean!
What are you doing?! 

ELREAN:
Master Wendel... 

WENDEL:
You still don't understand my decision,
do you? 
Indeed, as a mage, your power surpasses
mine. 
But you lack compassion.
That is why I did not grant you Excalibur. 

ELREAN:
...
Compassion...? 

WENDEL:
I had decided that you were to be my
successor when the time came. 
To think you would harbor a grudge towards
me... Does that not make you the same as
Garnef? 

ELREAN:
The same as Garnef...?
Teacher! What are you saying? 

WENDEL:
Ellerean, listen to me...
Garnef, along with Archbishop Miroa, were
Lord Gato's best pupils. 
But Lord Gato saw Garnef's weakness,
and so he left Khadein and the Aura tome
to Archbishop Miroa. 
Garnef, overcome by jealousy, stole the
Dark Orb from Lord Gato, and created
the Maph tome. 
As a result...
His heart was trapped within the Dark Orb
for all eternity. 
Originally Garnef was a youth with a 
strong sense of justice.
Wrath and envy led him to ruin. 

Do you understand now, Ellerean...? 

ELREAN:
...Teacher... 

WENDEL:
That is all that I can say to you.
I hope you will understand.
You still have many things to learn, 
and your will is too weak.
Do you really intend on retreading
Garnef's path? 

ELREAN:
...Teacher!
I'm so sorry. 
I... I was wrong. 
Please... find it in your heart to forgive me! 

WENDEL:
Ellerean, you will use that power of yours for
the good of the people. 
Understand? 


MS010_BT_JUCAPH:
*ELREAN enters*
ELREAN:
I won't lose to someone like Marich.
Anyone who sides with him is my enemy.
Thunder, strike them down! Thoron!! 


MS010_BT_JUCAPH_WENDEL:
*ELREAN enters*
ELREAN:
Why does everyone side with HIM...?
Even though... even though I'm stronger! 
*WENDEL enters*
WENDEL:
How horrible...
Consumed by your hatred, you have
forgotten what is truly important.

Sire, we've rescued the clerics that were

Excellent.

As thanks, they have offered to give us this.

*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
Marth...
Do you hear me? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gato!
Yes, I can. You are speaking to me through
magic, are you not? 

S_GATO:
Yes... You summoned me?
I will share with you my strength.
What is it that you wish for? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gato, I must ask: what has happened
to cause Hardin to suddenly change so
much? And what power is protecting him? 

S_GATO:
Hmm... The Dark Orb is the culprit...
Hardin's soul is trapped within the
Dark Orb... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
The Dark Orb?
What on earth is that? 



MS010_ED1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hmmm... I have no choice but to tell you.
Light, Star, Earth, Life and Darkness...
In this world, there exist five sacred orbs. 
Aside from the Light, Star and Earth Orbs,
there is also the Life Orb
and what is known as the Dark Orb. 
The Dark Orb opposes the Light Orb,
and it can greatly increase the
strength of one's mind. 
It can give its owner courage,
release them from suffering, and increase
their ambitions and wishes. 
In battle, it possesses the enemy's mind,
negating their attacks. 
But, the Dark Orb is too dangerous for
humans to use. It also amplifies wrath and
envy, causing them to increase tenfold. 
Eventually it will destroy their soul
and turn them into a demon. 
Hardin must have obtained the Dark Orb
from somewhere...
And now his heart has been lost to it. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
But why? Hardin isn't such a weak man.
He should have been happy after
his union with his beloved Princess Nina, 
so why the envy? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Prince...
Humans are never simple creatures... 
In any case, the only object that can
overcome Hardin's Dark Orb is the
Light Orb. 
If you want to do something about him,
then you had best come and get it from me. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh? Really, Lord Gato?
If we have the Light Orb then we can
save Hardin? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well... If his heart is not completely consumed,
then perhaps. But that depends on whether
Hardin is as strong-willed as you say... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gato!
Please, lend the Light Orb to me. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
If you come in person to the Ice Dragon
Shrine where I reside, then you shall have it. 
But that will be no easy task. 
There has only been one human that
has ever made it here.
That's right... The hero Anri. 
If you, like Anri, are a true hero,
I will lend you the Orb. 
So, Marth.
Do you have the courage to walk the path
that Anri walked? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, I do! I will go!!
Please, allow me to go! 
I must have the Light Orb!

MARIS:
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
I came here 'cause I heard Marth's group
was passing by, but, erm... 

PLAYER:
Sorry, who are you? 

MARIS:
I'm Maris.
A mercenary, and not a cheap one. 
I'd like to ask you something:
is yer prince okay with paying gold? 
Oh, of course, it's okay if I have to wait
until this war's over.
So, erm... 
If you, er, paid us, say... 590 gold for our
services, that ought to do, I think. 

PLAYER:
Huh? If it's only that much, then
Prince Marth would gladly pay... 

MARIS:
Phew! The rumors are true.
He's completely different from all our
employers up till now. Right, Pops? 
*MARIS leaves**DICE enters*
DICE:
He IS different.
Looks like we hit the jackpot coming to this
desert. 
I'm Dice.
On behalf of the both of us,
it's great to be in your service.

It concerns the assassins' movements...

is in peril.
