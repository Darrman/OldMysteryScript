*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
So this is the Ice Dragons' Temple.
The final destination of Anri's treacherous
journey... 

JEIGUN:
For his beloved Artemis, Anri obtained the
divine sword Falchion here. 
 He then proceeded to defeat Medeus and,
acclaimed by the people of Altea,
become their first king. 

MARS:
But, in the end he wasn't able to be
with Artemis... Why?
Weren't they loving together? 

JEIGUN:
The nobles of Archanea didn't want Anri,
a commoner, to become their king. 
More than that, they strongly
encouraged the princess to wed Duke Cartas,
who led the liberation army. 
Princess Artemis had no way of refusing.
"The bearer of the Fire Emblem must give
their life to the royal family." 
That is a saying passed down unchangingly
in House Archanea. 
And so, without telling a word to Anri,
the princess accepted her engagement
to Duke Cartas. 

MARS:
How could she?
That was unfair to Anri. 

JEIGUN:
The princess was just as worthy of pity.
It's said she died soon after giving
birth to her newborn prince. 
King Anri never married. So, the kingdom
of Altea was then succeeded by his younger
brother, King Marcelus. 
In other words, your great-grandfather. 

MARS:
Such a tragic tale...
So that was Artemis's fate? 
All because of the curse of the
Fire Emblem...?

*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
Prince Marth, can you hear me?
Come to the front of the center room.
I shall await you there. 


MS014_EV1:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
You have done well to make it this far,
Prince Marth! Anri's blood truly flows within
you. 
To reward your courage, I entrust you with
the Light Orb. 
This will nullify the Dark Orb's power.
Defeating Hardin will no longer be an
impossible task. 
And what of the star shards? 


MS014_EV2_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
What?!
You've collected them all! 
Goodness gracious.
With these, I can restore the Star Orb.
Wait one moment... 
*GATO enters*
GATO:
Marth.
This is the Star Orb.
I entrust this to you also. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh?
Lord Gato, why would you give me something
so precious? 

GATO:
Only you can restore the Shield of Seals...
The shield has chosen you. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Excuse me...? 


MS014_EV2_A2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Are you still in the dark?
The emblem shield you carry is the
Shield of Seals that was once stolen... 
To be honest, it was only recently
that I noticed; its exterior had
completely changed... 
After stealing it from Raman Temple,
the thief removed its jewels and sold
them off as treasures. 
The money was used to fund an army,
which, along with three stolen weapons,
was used to conquer the world. 
The thief that went on to become the
king of Akaneia had the shield, which
brought him such good fortune, 
it became the emblem of his royal family.
Now do you understand, Marth? It is what
you are carrying, Akaneia's Fire Emblem. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You mean...!
What... ...The first king of Akaneia
was originally a thief!?
Is that true...? 
In that case, I can kind of understand
the curse of the Fire Emblem... 
Lord Gato, does that mean...
If I were to place all five orbs into this,
the Shield of Seals will be restored? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
You are indeed correct...
But 600 years have passed since it broke... 
The earth dragons sealed under Macedonia
will soon awaken. 
There are several hundreds--no, several
thousands. 
I will entrust Chiki to you as well.
You will find her in the room to the right.
With her, you can defeat those dragons. 
But I must warn you.
If you do not complete the Shield of Seals,
even Chiki will be destroyed. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
What?!
But why!? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Because she is still a child.
Without the shield, she too will degenerate.. 
In time, she will turn into a beast and attack
humanity. 
I took pity on her and sent her to sleep. 
But if the Shield of Seals is restored,
we will no longer have to worry.
The shield will protect Chiki. 
Marth, I leave Chiki in your hands.
Please free her from her destruction. 


MS014_EV2_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see.
You couldn't collect them all... 
I suppose it couldn't be helped...
Nevertheless, I will take what shards you
have. 
Chiki is sleeping in the room to the right,
but since the shield has not been restored,
I cannot let you meet her. 
She has yet to mature into an adult.
Without the Shield of Seals, her degeneration
is but inevitable. 
In time, she will turn into a beast and attack
humanity. 
I'm afraid Chiki cannot ever be allowed to
awaken again. 'Tis for her own good... 
Marth, if you have taken the treasures,
then head to the room to the left.
I shall await you there... 


MS014_EV3:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
Chiki?!
Are you alright? 
*TIKI enters*
TIKI:
Yeah... 

MARS:
Chiki, it's me, Marth.
Hey, open your eyes! 

TIKI:
...Mar...
Mar-Mar... 
Oh, Mar-Mar!!
You came!
You came to see Chiki!! 

MARS:
That's right, Chiki.
It's been a while.
Have you been well? 

TIKI:
Uhh... not really.
Lord Gato said that I had to sleep again. 
But... I don't wanna.
I slept all by myself for a really long time. 
I had so many scary dreams, over and over. 
I dreamt I ended up like the poor fire dragons
and ice dragons... That I was a terrifying
monster. 
I'd attack humans and kill them. 
"No...", "Stop..." they'd shout, and then I'd
wake up. All alone, in this pitch black room... 
I cried so much. 
And each time, Ban-Ban comforted me. 
Then, one day he took me out, and brought
me to a human village. 
The village life was so fun!
Everyone treated me so nice...
I was really happy. 
I don't wanna sleep anymore...
Next time I close my eyes, I feel as though
I'll never open them again. 
I don't want that.
I want to live with everyone.
I don't want to sleep. 

MARS:
Chiki, it's alright now.
I'll protect you.
So don't cry anymore... 

TIKI:
Really...? I don't have to see those terrible
dreams anymore?! 

MARS:
Oh, of course! 
Once the Shield of Seals is restored, you can
come live with us. Chiki, trust me, and come
with me! 

TIKI:
Yeah! Yaaay!!
Thank you, Mar-Mar! 


MS014_EV4:
*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
It cannot be someone else.
Prince Marth himself needs to come here. 


MS014_EV5:
*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
I'm sorry, but I cannot let you see Chiki.
It's for her own good... 


MS014_BT_TIKI:
*TIKI enters*
TIKI:
Huh...?
Who... who are you...? 


MS014_DIE_TIKI:
*TIKI enters*
TIKI:
...Ah...
Mar...Mar... 


MS014_ED1_A:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
I see...
So Chiki was pretty happy.
It must have been very painful for her. 
Though it was to protect her, I was far too
cruel to her. I suspect she must really hate
me... 
You should go, Marth.
I will send you to Aritia with my powers. 



MS014_ED1_B:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
You should go, Marth.
I will send you to Aritia with my powers. 



MS014_ED2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gato, why don't you come with us? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Hmm...
At the moment I've one thing I must still
investigate. 
Garnef has returned. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Garnef...!?
But we killed him! 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, you killed his body. 
But his soul was held prisoner by the
Dark Orb, and within it, his hatred only
grew. 
Afterwards, his former disciples--the heretic
bishops--resurrected him. 
And they seem to be planning something foul. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see.
Very well, Lord Gato.
We shall split ways here. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Indeed.
If I find something, then I too will visit Aritia
afterwards. 
I'm counting on you, Marth.
Everything rests on your shoulders. 
You must save both our races from the path
of destruction.
