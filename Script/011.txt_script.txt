MARS:
Jeigan, where in the world are we...? 
*JEIGUN leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
This is the path depicted in the Anri Saga. 
The first obstacle in Anri's Way:
The Desert of Death. 
With its scorching sun, raging sandstorm,
savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns
that soar and dominate the skies. 
As the city of illusion shimmers in the
distance, we can only stand and gaze...
Or so the legend has it. 

MARS:
So Anri came through here as well.
And by himself, too... 

JEIGUN:
That's right. Your ancestor and Aritia's
founder, King Anri... 
To save Princess Artemis, he set out on a
journey to seek the divine sword Falchion. 
It's a long story, but I'll tell you the
legend of Anri. 
A century ago... The Holy Kingdom
of Akaneia, governor of this continent,
was ravaged by the dragonkin. 
The people back then lived days
of misery, as the dragons' slaves. 
Some people wielded weapons to fight
back, but they couldn't defeat the dragon
tribe, and many people died. 
House Akaneia, the people's only hope,
was eradicated, and the world descended
into despair. 
But, at the time, there were rumors of an
Akaneian princess hiding out in Aritia, 
which back then was no more than a provincial
town among many. 
The furious Durhuan Empire sent troops to
Aritia, demanding the princess's extradition. 
That princess - Artemis - planned to sacrifice
her own life in order to save the citizens. 
However, the people of Aritia protected
her, and vowed to fight, knowing they
would be massacred. 
Thanks to the heroic people of Aritia who stood
up to protect the princess, the people of
Akaneia came to know she was alive, 
and resumed their battle against Durhua. 
Their liberation army was led by
Duke Cartas, who fought with the royal
shield given to him by Artemis. 
As a result, he received enormous support.
Thanks to their efforts, the tides of
battle turned to their favor. 
However, the king of the earth dragons,
Mediuth, finally decided to make his move. 
The dark breath of earth dragons possessed
horrendous destructive power and had the
effect of halving the enemy's strength. 
Before his overwhelming might, it seemed
like Aritia's resistance wouldn't
last any longer. 
But then, a sage appeared before them.
He spoke of a divine sword enshrined in
the ice shrine in the distant north. 
With that blade, it would be possible to
fell Mediuth, but the way to obtain it
would be by no means easy... 

MARS:
So Anri, to save his beloved Artemis,
left on a journey to obtain the sword? 

JEIGUN:
Yes, that's right.
But I think that's enough for today.
We still have a long road ahead of us...

SHEEDA:
Jake!
What are you doing all the way out here...? 

JEIK:
Is that you, Sheeda?
Hey, long time no see.
I'm here to meet my beloved Anna. 

SHEEDA:
Huh? Anna lives in a place like this? 

JEIK:
Oh, you didn't know?
Anna's running a secret shop out here. 
It's a tiny bit troublesome coming here,
but y'know, love conquers all barriers! 
Your turn Sheeda. What're you doing in
the desert? 

SHEEDA:
Listen, Jake.
We're fighting for the peace of the continent
again. 
Could you help us, like old times...? 

JEIK:
I dunno, I kinda lost my ballista,
so I doubt I'd be much use to you. 

SHEEDA:
That's not true.
You'd help us a lot just by being there... 

JEIK:
Aw, shucks.
How could I say no when you say it like that? 
I bet Anna's worried about the war too.
Alrighty, I'll join you then.

Oopsy daisy.
Took you by surprise, didn't I? 
I couldn't help it after seeing that
serious expression on your face...
Sorry, don't be angry. 
I was ordered by Gato to wait here for you. 
While I was waiting I got more and 
more angry, wondering why I had to do
something so boring. 
So I thought I'd think of a
prank to pull on you. My Chiki impression
was pretty darn tootin', wasn't it? 
Did I provide some comic relief?
Huh, what's with the anxious face? 
Well, let's get goin'.
You wanted to see Lord Gato, right? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Chainy, how do you know Lord Gato? 
Just who are you? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Well, lemme see.
I don't think that really matters right now. 
So quit gapin' and follow me.
