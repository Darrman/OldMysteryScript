*MARS enters*
MARS:
How disgraceful...
Thieves inside our fair castle? 
What if they've stolen the Earth Orb? 
*JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking
thief making his way north.
We should capture him before it's too late. 

MARS:
Mmm, but we can use horses and Pegasi
inside, so what should we do...

*MARS enters**MISHRAN enters*
MISHRAN:
Prince Marth.
Please, hold on. 

MARS:
Mishelan!
Did you come here with Tomth? 

MISHRAN:
Correct. Tomth and I are going
to be your reinforcements.
Akaneia has nothing left for me. 
For the justice that I believe in,
allow me to fight by your side again,
Prince Marth.

*JORJUE enters**ASTRIA enters*
JORJUE:
Astria! 

ASTRIA:
Well, if it isn't the turncoat, George.
What form of death would you prefer? 

JORJUE:
H-hold your sword, Astria.General Eibel
has already fallen. Even if you fight
here, you've no chance of winning. 

ASTRIA:
You would have me surrender...? 
Never! Though I may be the last
man standing, I shall fight on.
I am a soldier of Akaneia! 

JORJUE:
Why do you fight?
For whom?
Emperor Hardin? 

ASTRIA:
I think not!
Not for him. 
For Princess Nina...
For Akaneia!! 

JORJUE:
Then tell me, was it Princess Nina
who ordered you to arms? 
Do you honestly believe that Princess
Nina would wish for a war like this? 

ASTRIA:
She...!
I have not seen the princess in some time. 
She has been ill of late. 
Hardin is the ruler of Akaneia and my liege.
I've no choice but to obey. 
If I do not, then I betray Akaneia.
And I betray Princess Nina. 

JORJUE:
Astria, Princess Nina entrusted Marth
with the Fire Emblem. 
Do you understand what that entails? 

ASTRIA:
C-come again?!
What are you trying to tell me, George? 
Are you suggesting that Princess
Nina asked Prince Marth for help? 

JORJUE:
Is there any other reason? 
Come with us, Astria.
See the truth with your own eyes. 
If you die here, how would Midia feel? 
Live, Astria, for her.
Live, and face the truth of what
has come to pass. 

ASTRIA:
Hmm... I suppose it is unavoidable.
But, George-- 
Should I learn that this war is a
product of Marth's ambition,
as Emperor Hardin claims... 
Heads will roll.
Am I clear? 


MS016_EV1:
*WILLOW enters**SOLDIER_RED enters*
SOLDIER_RED:
Lord Willow, permission to open the
door and attack? 

WILLOW:
Wait.
Don't be so hasty. 
Inform me as soon as any of the chests
in the treasury are opened.
We will sortie the moment that happens. 
Both the thieves and the Aritians will
want their greasy hands on the loot. 
While they're busy trying to unload
the chests, we will take that chance
and attack. 
Heh heh...
This is a battle of intellect, not brawn. 
Don't forget!
Attack when the chests are sprung! 


MS016_EV2:
*WILLOW enters*
INSERTNAMEHERE:
What's that?
The chests have been sprung?
Now! Open the door! 
Heh heh heh!
Their panicked faces will be glorious!

ASTRIA:
Traitors!
You will feel Miracle's bite!!

Perhaps it is time you realize...
The terror of my magic...!

*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire.
We have routed the enemy. 
At last, Aritia is ours once more. 

MARS:
Yes, it's a wondrous feeling.
But is there news of Ellis...?

MS016_ED1_02_PCF1:
*S_GATO enters*
S_GATO:
Prince Marth...
Can you hear me? 
I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings,
but it would seem that Princess Ellis
has been kidnapped by Garnef. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Lord Gato... Do you speak truly?! 

S_GATO:
I have found out that Garnef
commanded his priests to search for
clerics of noble birth. 
*MARS enters*
S_GATO:
It is most likely that Rena, Maria, and your
sister were spirited away by Garnef. 

MARS:
It can't be! 
What does he intend to do with them!? 

S_GATO:
That, I do not know.
But something foul is on the cards. 
There can be no doubt of Garnef's
involvement in this series
of unfortunate events. 

MARS:
Lord Gato!
Where is Garnef now? 

S_GATO:
I believe Princess Nina is his next target.
He is probably... at Akaneia's palace. 

MARS:
I understand.
Then I too shall go to Akaneia. 
I still have to free Hardin from
the Dark Orb's influence. 
I will defeat the Demon King
Garnef, and rescue my sister--no,
I'll save all of them!
