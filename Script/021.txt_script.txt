*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
Jeigan, where are we?
Macedonia? Or Durhua? 

JEIGUN:
Both--we are precisely on the border.
I hear this place is home to Macedonia's
great wyverns. 
But since the area is overrun with
barbarians, 
even the Macedonian soldiers dare not
set foot in here. 

MARS:
I see.
You learn something new every day... 

MARS:
Anyway,
let's go, Jeigan. 
I need to know what's happened to
my sister and the others...
I have a dreadful feeling about this.

*MARS enters**HYMIR enters*
HYMIR:
There you are, Marth! 

MARS:
You're...Ymir! 
Yeah, the name's Ymir.
I heard you were fightin' here and
figured I'd come along too. 


MS021_EV1_PCM1:
*MARS enters**HYMIR enters*
HYMIR:
There you are, Marth!

MS021_EV2:
*MINERBA enters*
MINERBA:
............ 
Brother...?
Could it be...
Is it really you...? 
*Y_MISHEIL enters*
Y_MISHEIL:
...Minerva...? 

MINERBA:
Ah!
You're wounded!
I'll go get help! 

Y_MISHEIL:
Don't bother...
This wound is beyond help. 
I'd rather you call for... Prince Marth.
I have... something I must pass on to him. 

MINERBA:
The prince will be here soon.
Hold on, Brother!
I'll tend to your wound... 

Y_MISHEIL:
Heh...
To think I'd need your help in the end... 
Guh... ngh...! 

MINERBA:
Brother! 

Y_MISHEIL:
Minerva... I have something to ask of you.
Should I die...
Give this tome to Prince Marth. 
This is as far as I can go...
I leave the rest... to you... 

MINERBA:
B--Brother... Misheil...! 
No... This isn't like you!
When did you become so weak!? 
The brother I knew was strong and noble...
He always found his own way,
never relying on anyone else... 
Do you hear me? 
I won't accept this!
You're going to pass this on yourself,
without the help of your younger sister. 

Y_MISHEIL:
Hmph...
Am I being scolded now...? 

MINERBA:
Brother, listen to me...
You cannot die here.
You have to live...! 


MS021_H1:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
There's a small hill called the Dragon's
Altar on the other side of this mountain. 
Lately, I've been hearin' some peculiar
roars coming from the vicinity. 
They're sayin' the Devil's been revived
or summat like that. 
Don't you guys go near there, 'kay? 


MS021_H2:
*UNCLE enters*
UNCLE:
This here's the Dragon's Dale.
Don't go past this point, alright? 
All them big, scary wyverns'll burn you
to a crisp!! A crisp, you hear!! 


MS021_VIL1:
*MARS enters**Y_MISHEIL enters*
MARS:
Prince Misheil?!
What are you doing here? 
Those--those wounds!
What happened to you?! 

Y_MISHEIL:
......Marth, huh...?
...I was waiting...
for you... 

MARS:
For me?! 

Y_MISHEIL:
...Take this... 

MARS:
Ah...!
This is the Starlight tome!
You're giving this to me? 

Y_MISHEIL:
Yes... Heh...
Only this tome can... damage Garnef.
I stole it from him, but not without cost... 

MARS:
Garnef, you say?!
Where is he now? 

Y_MISHEIL:
At the Dragon's Altar... 
Heh... how pathetic...
Somebody of my caliber...
would fall foul... to Garnef? 
Marth... Please...
I am not long for this world.
If Minerva is still alive... 

Tell her...
to save... Maria...
in my place... please... 

MARS:
Misheil! 

Y_MISHEIL:
Marth...
I leave Maria to you... ngh... 


MS021_ED1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
So this is the Dragon's Altar.
The place where divine dragon Narga
banished the earth dragons... 
*GATO enters*
GATO:
Indeed. Mediuth, the altar's guardian,
could not tolerate the human race's
atrocities against the Mamkutes. 
Thus, he gathered the surviving dragonkin,
forming the Durhuan Empire. 
All to obliterate mankind. 
He was vanquished by Anri once and
then defeated a second time by you. 
However earth dragons boast tremendous
life force, and cannot be completely
eliminated so easily... 
Even now, they sleep at this altar. 

MARS:
You mean to say they'll awaken?! 

GATO:
Not exactly. Even sleeping earth dragons
should not awaken for centuries or so. 
The next time Mediuth awakens though,
he will rise as a terrifying Dark Dragon... 
No, wait...! Perhaps...?
Yes, I see...
So that's why Garnef... 

MARS:
What's the matter, Lord Gato? 

GATO:
Prince Marth.
I have finally realized the reason
why Garnef kidnapped the clerics. 
He intends to use them to resurrect Mediuth. 
To hasten the awakening of a dragon
requires the life force of
pure, maiden women. 
Knowing this, Garnef kidnapped them. 

MARS:
So that means Ellis and the
others are in this very altar? 

GATO:
Indubitably...
Marth, you must hurry.
They are in grave danger! 
Mediuth's awakening...
is only a matter of time!! 


MS021_ED2:
*PLAYER enters**HYMIR enters*
HYMIR:
Want a hat? 


MS021_ED2_A:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, I'd love to. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Whoa!
I'm so stoked you said that! 
It'll look great on you!
No doubt about it. 


MS021_ED2_B:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Oh no, I don't think it suits me. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
That so...?
Too bad. But, oh well. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I'm sorry.
After you went to all that trouble too... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
It's fine, it's fine.
I don't mind at all. 


MS021_ED3:
*Y_MISHEIL enters**MINERBA enters*
MINERBA:
Brother...... 
Brother... why...?
Why here...? 
I--I never wanted to fight you...! 
I just wanted things to be like
they used to...
With you and Maria... 
Brother...... Misheil... Bro...ther......! 

Y_MISHEIL:
...Your tears...
How long has it been since I saw them last...? 

MINERBA:
What...? M-Misheil?! Are you...? 

Y_MISHEIL:
I don't plan on dying in front of you,
Minerva. I'd be an endless laughing stock. 
The Misheil you knew...
would never die in a place like this. 
Am I right? 

MINERBA:
Brother...! Oh, Brother! 

Y_MISHEIL:
Hmph, don't get the wrong idea.
You and I are still enemies...
That will not change. 
The incompetence of your army sickens me,
so you leave me with no choice but to help. 

MINERBA:
Thank goodness...
You've finally returned to your old self. 
I understand.
Until the Dark Dragon breathes his last,
let us borrow your strength.
