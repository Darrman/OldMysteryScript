*MARS enters*
MARS:
I see my sister and the others...
But who are they guarding...? 
No, it can't be...
That's--that's Mediuth...! 
*JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
With the princesses around him, sire,
you'll be unable to strike down Mediuth. 
If we don't do something soon, then the
other dragons will awaken, and this battle
will rapidly escalate into mayhem. 
The princesses will be then be
in even more pain.
MARS:
Then, what do you suppose I do? 
How on earth can we save them?!
Tell me, Jeigan! 

JEIGUN:
I...
I do not know... 
But, if we are to defeat Mediuth,
we must stop at nothing... 

MARS:
What?!
...You can't mean to kill them?! 

JEIGUN:
It may be... necessary. 
As they are now, they suffer greatly. 
We must save them, even if it should
cost them their lives... 

MARS:
Jeigan, this--is this really a
decision I must make? 

JEIGUN:
You are Aritia's crown prince, sire.
A ruler must be ready for anything,
though it may cost them their happiness. 
That is all. 

MARS:
Enough, Jeigan. I understand.
Still, I cannot accept it.
There must be another way. 
Even till the very end,
I will never give up!!

*JURIAN enters**S_RENA enters*
JURIAN:
Rena, snap out of it!
C'mon, it's me! Julian!
What's wrong with you, Rena? 
I know I'm a good-for-nothing scoundrel,
but for you, I'd do anything. 
I don't want anything else--
I just want to see your smile again. 
Hey, Rena; could you smile for me?
Please... 
*S_RENA leaves**RENA enters*
RENA:
Oh... Julian...?
You came. 
I knew you'd find me. I knew it.
That's why, I could continue struggling
in the darkness of my soul... 
Julian, I'm sorry.
I've always been a bother to you. 

JURIAN:
Are you kiddin' me, Rena...?
I'm just happy to hear your voice again. 

RENA:
Julian, there's something I'd like very much.
Will you listen? 

JURIAN:
Huh?
Sure, Rena, hit me.
So long as it's within my power... 

RENA:
Could you call me... "honey"? 
You're always "Rena" this and "Rena" that.
You speak as though we're barely friends--
and I don't like that feeling. 
That just won't do, especially not after
we settle down together in Macedonia. 

JURIAN:
Huh? ...What're you talking about, Rena...?
Er... I mean... H-honey...
Don't tell you and I are gonna... 

RENA:
Uh-huh... I'm sure God will forgive me. 
After all, you...
You mean the world to me.

Everything's going to be okay. 
I'm so sorry, Maria.
I've left you alone for so long... 

MARIA:
Minerva...
I was scared... I was so scared... 
Oh!
How is Misheil? 
I think he fought Garnef to save me. 

MINERBA:
Misheil... is fine.
Don't worry, Maria. 

MARIA:
Really?
Then, once we go home, we'll be together
again just like before? 
I'm so glad, Minerva!
Oh, I hope we can see him soon. 

MINERBA:
Maria......

SIRIUS:
Princess Nina!
Open your eyes!
Be strong...! 

S_NIENA:
Ahh...
I've done something terrible. 
I was too foolish...
I hurt Hardin... I drove him to despair. 

SIRIUS:
My queen...
Prince Marth has ended Hardin's suffering. 
The Emperor loved you till the very end.
He was sorry for what he'd done to you. 
It's alright now.
You need not worry. 
It was all just a bad dream... 
*S_NIENA leaves**NIENA enters*
NIENA:
......
Who......? 

SIRIUS:
Princess Nina!
You mustn't give up.
You shouldn't be a weak person!
NIENA:
Oh...! You're...
Camus...?!
Camus!! 
Why... Why are you...
This is a dream, isn't it?
You're still alive... Ah... It's true... 

SIRIUS:
Nngh!
...My queen... You are mistaken... 
I am Sirius,
a soldier of the allied forces.
I know not of this Camus... 

NIENA:
Sirius...?! ...It can't be...
No! You're wrong!!
You're... 

SIRIUS:
Please, calm yourself;
you must be exhausted. 
I must depart soon. 
Queen Nina, listen to me...
You should head to Prince Marth. 

NIENA:
You...
Where are you going? 

SIRIUS:
I must go to my country.
There's... someone waiting for me. 

NIENA:
Is... Is that so...?
I see... Sirius...
Thank you. I am most grateful. 

SIRIUS:
...Forgive me... 

NIENA:
Pardon...?! 

SIRIUS:
No... It is nothing...
Now, Queen Nina; go!

Princess Ellis!
It's me, Marich.
Snap out out of it! 
I--I studied magic ferociously,
all so that I could protect you...

I failed. 
I couldn't be by your side,
when you needed me most. 
Ellis... Please.
Please open your eyes!

It's alright now.
I'm here, so... 
Oh... but Prince Marth is...
Everyone's watching, so we can't...
Oh well... *ahem*

Never again shall I abandon you!
