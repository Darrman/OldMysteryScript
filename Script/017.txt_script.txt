MS017_OP1:
*SIMA enters**SAMSON enters*
SAMSON:
Princess Sheema, the Aritian army has come. 

SIMA:
I see...
The end draws near. 
Samson, I ought to apologize for burdening
you. 
However I must see my kingdom through till
the very end. You may go. 

SAMSON:
That's quite enough, I think, Princess.
King Jiol took your mother away from you:
you should despise him. 
Isn't that why you hid at Pales and 
stayed away from this country? 
Now, you're just lettin' Hardin make a fool
of you. 

SIMA:
I probably am a fool. I did as he asked,
because he told me the people of Gra
wished for their motherland's restoration. 
But Hardin only intended to use us. 
Now that we've outlived our use, he's tossed
us aside like rubbish. 
All the same, I won't move! 
My men are not disposable! 

SAMSON:
How sad... 
You'll have new recruits hold back the elite
Aritian army alone? 
Fine. If you say you'll remain here, then I'll
fight for you until the end, too.
Well, this should be fun, at least. 

SIMA:
Samson...
Why would you do this? 
Don't you mercenaries only live for gold? 
I have no more to give you... 

SAMSON:
Well, I don't quite get it, either. 
But... there are times when a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do. That's all I can say...
For now. 
Besides, I want to see how that kid fights. 
If he's a true hero, perhaps your decision
will change. 


MS017_EV1:
*SIMA enters*
SIMA:
What...?!
What have you done...? 
I believed you, Aritia;
I trusted you...
How dare you... I'll kill all of you! 

*SIMA leaves**SAMSON enters*
SAMSON:
Prince Marth...
How unfortunate.
I thought you a better man. 


MS017_EV2:
*SIMA enters*
SIMA:
What...?!
What have you done...? 
I believed you, Aritia;
I trusted you...
How dare you... I'll kill all of you! 


MS017_TK1:
*MARS enters**SIMA enters*
MARS:
Princess Sheema? Thank goodness.
It's good to see you're well. 
Let us be clear: I do not hold
animosity towards the Kingdom of Gra. 
Our kingdoms were once one. 
The country may have divided after Anri's
death, but we always got on well as allies. 
It grieved me to watch us go our
separate ways in the last war. 
Princess Sheema,
I would like to try once more.
I do not wish to fight with Gra. 

SIMA:
Prince Marth...
It surprised me to learn that you hadn't
laid a finger on my fleeing soldiers. 
You may just be the second coming
of King Anri. 
I believe you. 
If it's not too much to ask...
Please, accept the people of Gra...
as you would those of Aritia. 
I entrust all of my country...
to you, Prince Marth. 


MS017_TK2:
*SIMA enters**SAMSON enters*
SAMSON:
Well, Sheema.
I guess my job here is done. 

SIMA:
Samson...
You're leaving...? 

SAMSON:
I don't think you'll be needin' me.
After all, the prince will protect you from
here on. 

SIMA:
Don't go!
Please, don't go...! 

SAMSON:
W-what?
Why are you makin' me stay?
This ain't like you. 
...Well, whatever.
If you still need me, then I'm not goin'
anywhere. 
Wherever you go, I'll protect you.
Is that the deal? 

SIMA:
Yes... 


MS017_H1:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
Hardin placed soldiers 'ere to
ensure Gra's loyalty. 
But only the Akaneian soldiers
have any will to fight. 


MS017_H2:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
Princess Sheema is the daughter of
King Jiol's second wife. 
But unlike the king, Princess Sheema
is a very kind person. 
She'd risk her own life for her soldiers. 
Isn't there anyone who'll help her? 


MS017_H3:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
The soldiers 'ere are all amateurs. 
Our country's knights all fell in battle. 
There's no one left to protect our country. 
And now, the Akaneian soldiers
do as they please. 
They're worse than thieves!
Brutes, barbarians! 


MS017_VIL1:
*MARS enters**WOMAN1 enters*
WOMAN1:
Oh... please, spare me.
I have nothing left to give. 

MARS:
Please don't get the wrong idea.
We're not here to take anything from you. 

WOMAN1:
But didn't you Aritians come here
to exact revenge on us? 

MARS:
No, we've no intention to fight Gra.
Gra and Aritia were like siblings once. 

WOMAN1:
You speak truly...?
Then, I shall give you...
my dearest, most precious treasureÂ± 


MS017_VIL2:
*MARS enters**THORMAS enters*
THORMAS:
Prince Marth,
I've been waiting for you. 
I'm Thomas,
an Akaneian soldier--or was.
I've since retired from the army. 
The Akaneians here just want to
sacrifice the defenceless Gra soldiers. 
This act of brutality by my
former homeland...
I cannot tolerate. 
Please, Prince Marth.
Let me fight with you in some way. 


MS017_BT_BOSS:
*SIMA enters*
SIMA:
You dastards!
How dare you slaughter my people!
I'll kill you all! 


MS017_BT_SAMSON:
*SAMSON enters*
SAMSON:
I know that Gra cannot prevail.
But Sheema deserves better than this. 


MS017_DIE_BOSS:
*SIMA enters*
SIMA:
Forgive me, my people. 


MS017_DIE_SAMSON:
*SAMSON enters*
SAMSON:
Sheema... 


MS017_ED1_PCF1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, to keep fighting like this
is pointless. 
All we are accomplishing is
buying Hardin more time. 

MARS:
My thoughts exactly. 
If we continue like this,
more blood will be spilt for naught. 
So I have decided on a different
route for us to go. 
How about we go directly south from Menedi,
and enter Pales from Adria Peak? 

JEIGUN:
But the steep mountains make it
dangerous for an army of our size. 

MARS:
I am prepared for the danger.
We managed to conquer the same perilous
road that Anri walked. Compared to that... 
Jeigan.
We can overcome this challenge.
JEIGUN:
...That's a fair point.
If we can cross it, we can attack
the enemy from the rear. 
Order the advance!

MS017_ED_BS:
*PLAYER enters**FROST enters*
FROST:
Oof...
Seems I've finally caught up. 

PLAYER:
Hmm, and you are? 

FROST:
My name is Frost.
I am a priest of Macedonia. 
When Macedonia was taken over by
those warmonging rebels... 
You came and saved our country.
Thanks to you, my family's now safe. 
I have come to return the favor. 

PLAYER:
I see.
But hasn't it been some time since
Prince Marth freed Macedonia...? 

FROST:
Your army marched at speed and
this old geezer just couldn't keep up.
Eventually I lost sight of you... 
But then I heard that Marth had freed
Aritia as well, and I finally managed
to catch up with you here, in Gra. 
I am old now, but I can still fight.
Please, allow me to to join you.
