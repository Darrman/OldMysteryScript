*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
What is this strange air?
It feels like it's full of evil spirits. 

JEIGUN:
That is true...
My body appears to be frozen. 
These are the evil spirits of the
Earth Dragons. Your highness, it seems
we can't have everybody enter ahead. 
Since we don't know what
will happen, please choose carefully
who to take with you. 

MARS:
I hope to at least take the people
who are worried about the four sisters. 

JEIGUN:
Mmm... There's no avoiding that.
But how many people will survive?
I bet this will be a fierce battle. 


MS022_OP1:
*MARS enters**GATO enters*
GATO:
Prince Marth, in this altar lurks many
savage barbarians and mage dragons
long gone mad. 
They have fallen under Garnef's spell
and will attack you given the chance. 
Garnef's servants--
the heretic priests possess great power.
They are not to be taken lightly. 
If you let this battle drag on,
it may become fiercer than you can handle.
Do not stop. Make for the end at once! 
Once you defeat Garnef, retrieve the
Falchion that he stole from your Aritia. 
As you well know, without the Falchion,
defeating Mediuth will be nigh impossible... 

MARS:
I understand, Lord Gato. 
My friends and I shall sally forth
to the deepest depths of the altar! 

GATO:
It would be wise to bring this ally with you.
She has deigned to lend you her strength.

No, I don't believe we've ever met.
But, why...?
I have the strangest feeling that I know her... 

NAGA:
My name... is Nagi.
I will... stop the enemy...
You must hurry to the throne room... 
Go...
This time... everything...

I-I see. Well then, let's go!
