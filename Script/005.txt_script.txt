MTUTS_TRANING:


MS005_OP1:
*TORUS enters**RANG enters*
TORUS:
Commander Lang.
The... A-Aritian army has arrived... 

RANG:
You moron. Why are you so panicked?
With their nation and name in ruins, the
Aritians are of no consequence to us.
 

TORUS:
But, Sir George's archers left to quell the
rebellion. Can we win with just our troops? 

RANG:
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Call George back to the castle this instant! 
While you're there, find that hired sword,
Navarre, and bring him here. 
General Toras! I'm heading inside.
You will defend this location till your last
breath. 
Do NOT let the enemy get close.
Do I make myself clear?! 


MS005_EV0:
*BANDIT enters*
BANDIT:
Whoo!
Ready, boys? 
Look at all the ruckus!
Never a better time to attack that buncha
villages! 


MS005_EV1:
*SOLDIER_RED enters**JORJUE enters*
SOLDIER_RED:
Captain George.
We've received orders to return to the
castle immediately. 

JORJUE:
Orders from Lang, huh?
I'm not fond of that man. 
His treatment of our people is simply
intolerable. 
To work beneath him is an insult. 
Pay his orders no mind. 

SOLDIER_RED:
But, Captain!
You'll be accused of treason! 
Captain?!
You can't be planning to defect to Aritia... 

JORJUE:
No, that's not an option. 
If I were to defect now, I'd drag the entire
platoon down with me. 
So for that reason alone,
I will absolutely not take any risks
that might besmirch our name. 

SOLDIER_RED:
Captain George... 

JORJUE:
Anyway, inform everyone:
Do not move from your stations. 
However, if the enemy approaches,
you may engage them. 


MS005_TK1:
*RICARD enters**JURIAN enters*
JURIAN:
Hey, Ricardo!
I see you haven't tired of stealin'. 

RICARD:
Ah! Chief!
How nice to see ya. 
Well, I was plannin' on workin' with you and
makin' loadsa money, but you had to go and
quit the business! 
Fallin' head over heels for that beautiful
cleric, and then dumpin' me...
That's just too cruel! 
Did our love really mean that little to you? 

JURIAN:
Can it, you little fink!!
People'll get the wrong idea about us,
if you keep talkin' like that. 
Anyway, forget about thievin' and come with
me to fight for justice. 

RICARD:
Hmm... alright then! 
I'll follow you anywhere.
I do adore ya, Chief! 


MS005_TK2:
*BARTS enters**SAJI enters*
SAJI:
Barts!
What're you doin' in a place like this?! 

BARTS:
Saji?
It's been a while. 
Fighting's a thing of the past for me.
I'm just an ordinary woodcutter now.
Move along; nothing to see here. 

SAJI:
Don't be an idiot.
Doncha know?
This is Prince Marth's fight. 
If you ignore his plea, you're a disgrace to
the Talisian Mercenaries.
Tell me you're no disgrace. 

BARTS:
......
You know, all I really want is to live in peace... 
I suppose I can't just kick back,
and chop my wood, with this damn war
going on. This needs to end quickly. 

SAJI:
Oh yeah!
That's my bro! 

BARTS:
Yeah, I'll join too.
Tell Prince Marth for me. 


MS005_TK3:
*BARTS enters**MAJI enters*
MAJI:
Barts!
What're you doin' here?! 

BARTS:
Saji?
Long time no see. 

MAJI:
I'm not Saji!
I'm Maji! 
You of all people should know that! 

BARTS:
It was a joke! Sorry.
Look, Maji, I know you came out all this way... 
But I've got nothing to do with war no more.
I'm an ordinary woodcutter now.
Just ignore me. 

MAJI:
Don't be stupid.
Doncha know?
Prince Marth's fighting again. 
If you ignore his plea, you're a disgrace to
the Talisian Mercenaries.
You wanna be a disgrace, is that it? 

BARTS:
......
You know, all I really want is to live in peace... 
I suppose I can't just kick back,
and chop my wood, with this damn war
going on. This needs to end quickly. 

MAJI:
Heh! That's my bro. 

BARTS:
Yeah, I'll join too.
Tell Prince Marth for me. 


MS005_TK4:
*BARTS enters**OGUMA enters*
OGUMA:
Long time no see, Barts. 

BARTS:
Captain Oguma!
Why are you here...? 

OGUMA:
Another war has started.
Once again, I fight under Prince Marth's
banner. 
Barts, lend us your strength.
We need you. 

BARTS:
I got nothing to do with fighting now...
Well, that's what I would say if you were
anyone else. 
Captain, I owe you.
You've saved our sorry asses on more
occasions than one. 
Captain Oguma.
Just say the word.
I'll do whatever you want! 


MS005_H1:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
Y'know, lately I haven't seen that mercenary,
Samto. 
I thought that he might have joined your
ranks, but I guess not... 
He's as lax as they get, but you can't go
wrong with his skill. 


MS005_H2:
*WOMAN1 enters*
WOMAN1:
Oh, Aritians, hear our plea!
Please, defeat General Lang! 
As long as that man lives,
peace is but a fleeting dream. 


MS005_VIL1:
*VILHEAD enters*
VILHEAD:
Ohh, if isn't Prince Marth!
I wonder how my granddaughter Rena is
faring, hm? 
What, you don't know?
I see... Th-then...
Do you still want this Hammerne staff? 
At least, if Rena's pupil Malliesia were around,
I'm sure she could use it... 
Well, whatever be the case,
I've no use for a souvenir.
Please, make good use of it. 


MS005_BT_BARTS:
*BARTS enters*
BARTS:
Oi, quit it!
I don't want to get involved in no war! 


MS005_BT_JORJUE:
*JORJUE enters*
JORJUE:
You wouldn't have needed to die if you
hadn't come so close... 


MS005_BT_RICARD:
*RICARD enters*
RICARD:
Chief, where aaare ya? 


MS005_BT_TORUS:
*TORUS enters*
TORUS:
Projection 44.5 degrees!
Fiiiire!!! 


MS005_DIE_BARTS:
*BARTS enters*
BARTS:
Damn it...
What a world... 


MS005_DIE_JORJUE:
*JORJUE enters*
JORJUE:
Fools... 


MS005_DIE_RICARD:
*RICARD enters*
RICARD:
Tch. Man, I messed up big time. 


MS005_DIE_TORUS:
*TORUS enters*
TORUS:
General Lang...
Aritia is too strong... 


MS005_ED1_PCF1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we've finally seized control of Grunia. 
However, a number of enemies are
concealed within the castle.
Our job here is far from over. 

MARS:
Yes, I know. 
Lang must be stopped here and now.
Or else we forsake the people of Grunia. 

JEIGUN:
This is Lang we are talking about.
We don't know what he's planning. 
We must take extra caution when
fighting inside the castle!
