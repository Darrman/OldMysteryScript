MS002_OP1:
*MARS enters**KATUA enters*
KATUA:
Prince Marth!!
Thank goodness you've come to Macedonia! 

MARS:
Katua?!
I received word that there was a rebellion
in Macedonia. Are you unharmed? 

KATUA:
Yes, I'm fine. My older sister Paola and I
managed to escape somehow. 
But Princess Minerva was captured by
the rebels. 
Prince Marth, please...
You have to rescue Princess Minerva!
At this rate, her life will be in danger! 

MARS:
Of course I will help her.
Katua, please take us to where she is. 

KATUA:
Yes, my lord! 
But first we have to break through these
woods. 
General Rumel's dragon knight squad is
lurking within this area. 
If we approach from the front,
we'll be easy pickings for them. 

MARS:
I see... So you're suggesting we flank them
from the left or the right. 
Thank you, Katua.
Leave it to us! 


MS002_H1:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
Warren's a bit of an idiot.
Just 'cause they payed him well, he went
ahead and joined the rebel army! 
Ahh, to think a fool like him was once
acquainted with the fair Katua... 


MS002_H2:
*LADY enters*
LADY:

Look out for those pilfering thieves.
If they take off with your precious treasure,
you won't ever get it back. 
Never let them escape from your sight. 


MS002_H3:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
Because of the last war, every nation has
been forced to lead hard lives. 
The only well-off country is Akaneia,
ruled by Emperor Hardin. 


MS002_H4:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
Some dirty thieves took our village treasure,
the Lady Sword, and ran off with it. 
Only women can wield the incredible power
of that sword. 
Please, prise it back from their filthy hands. 


MS002_H5:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
Beware when dragon knights are around.
Even from a far-off distance, they can
move all at once and swoop down on you! 


MS002_TK1:
*KATUA enters**WOLLEN enters*
KATUA:
Warren?!
Even a good man like you has sided with
the rebel army... 

WOLLEN:
Katua the White, huh?
It's been a while. 
You know I'm just a common hunter.
If they pay me enough, I'll do anything. 

KATUA:
Warren, listen to me! 
Princess Minerva endeavored to create a
country where its people could live at ease. 
She exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute
to accomplish that goal. 
But General Ryuke, despite knowing this,
roused the soldiers into a coup d'etat. 
Can't you see? He's just trying to make this
country into his own! 
And you can honestly say you're okay with
that? 

WOLLEN:
...I see.
Well, I don't like the military acting as if they
owned the place... 
Alright then.
If you're going to help the princess,
then so will I. 


MS002_VIL1:
*MARS enters**MAJI enters*
MAJI:
O'er here! Prince Marth! 

MARS:
You're... Maji! 
What are you doing so far from Talis? 

MAJI:
I couldn't sit still when I heard you's
fighting again, so I came to join in. 
We're Talis's mercenaries, right?
If ya died, Princess Sheeda'd cry. 
Prince Marth, lemme fight too.
I'll join you's army. 


MS002_BT_BOSS:
*LUMEL enters*
LUMEL:
Taste the terror of Macedonia's fearless
dragon knight squad! 


MS002_BT_WOLEN:
*WOLLEN enters*
WOLLEN:
No hard feelings.
I don't have anything against you,
but this is the way I live. Forgive me! 


MS002_DIE_BOSS:
*LUMEL enters*
LUMEL:
General Ryuke, I leave the rest to you... 


MS002_DIE_WOLEN:
*WOLLEN enters*
WOLLEN:
Damn it...
I should've seen this coming... 


MS002_ED1_PCF1:
*JEIGUN enters**MARS enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we found someone most unusual confined
in one of the fortress rooms. 
*JEIGUN leaves**RINDA enters*
MARS:
Hm? ...Linda!
How did you wind up in a dangerous place
like this? 

RINDA:
Prince Marth! Thank heavens.
What a pleasant surprise meeting you here. 
I desperately needed to see you again,
so I set out to find you. 
But the Macedonian soldiers found me
suspicious and they dragged me to this
fortress... 

MARS:
Is that so?
I'm glad you're safe.
But, why were you looking for me? 
Shouldn't you be by Princess Nina's side? 

RINDA:
I was requested by Princess Nina to deliver
you this.

*JEIGUN leaves**RINDA enters*
MARS:
Hm? ...Linda!

RINDA:
Prince Marth! Thank heavens.
What a pleasant surprise meeting you here. 
I desperately needed to see you again,
so I set out to find you. 
But the Macedonian soldiers found me
suspicious and they dragged me to this
fortress... 

MARS:
Is that so?
I'm glad you're safe.Coming here by yourself
was a dangerous thing to do. 
But, why were you looking for me?
Shouldn't you be by Princess Nina's side? 

RINDA:
I was requested by Princess Nina to deliver
you this. 


MS002_ED1_02_PCF1:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Huh?
This...!
This is the Fire Emblem! 
The royal heirloom of Akaneia:
the Emblem Shield! 
But why give this to me now? 
Especially at a time when Akaneia has so
much influence under Emperor Hardin's reign? 
In this peaceful age, why is Princess Nina
giving me the "Champion's Proof"...? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I don't understand either.
Princess Nina didn't explain why,
just that I had to give it to you... 
I remember her eyes seemed so sad...
I think she may have been crying... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Princess Nina crying?!
What on earth has been happening...? 
Linda, after this battle ends,
I will go see Princess Nina. 
Until then, I want you to remain with us. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Yes, Prince Marth!!
