*MARS enters**KAIN enters*
KAIN:
Sire, you're safe! 
*MARS leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
I'm truly glad that you came back unharmed,
Kain. 

KAIN:
Yeah, somehow I managed to shake off the
enemy and escape here. 
But the enemy is already approaching from
the north. 
*MARS leaves**MARS enters*
MARS:
Don't worry.
We will crush them. 

KAIN:
No, not this time. 
Hardin is being protected by a mysterious
power: we can't lay a finger on him. 
So even if we fight now, we haven't a
chance of winning. 
Please, head to the northwestern fortress.
There's a boat across the river, which we
can use to escape to the Khadein desert. 
*KAIN leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, the free company to the south will
probably make their move soon.
Indeed, now's not the time to fight. 
For the time being, let's do as Kain suggests
and make our escape.
After that, we'll think of something... 

MARS:
I see...
I don't like it, but we haven't a choice... 
Everyone, hurry to the northwest fortress!

Who are you?
Your face is unknown to me. 
*PLAYER enters*PLAYER
PLAYER:
.
I am Prince Marth's Royal Guard. 
Emperor Hardin of Akaneia, the prince
told me that you were once a trusted friend. 
Why would you do something like this? 
*HARDIN leaves**HARDIN enters*PLAYER
HARDIN:
, is it...?
What does it matter to you?
You will die here regardless. 


MS008_BT_HARDIN_E_PC_PCM1:
*HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
Who are you?
Your face is unknown to me. 
*PLAYER enters*PLAYER
PLAYER:
.
I am Prince Marth's Royal Guard. 
Emperor Hardin of Akaneia, I never knew
you in the past. 
But I do know this: you are now the prince's
enemy. 
*HARDIN leaves**HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
You may come, PLAYER.
But no one may even scratch me. 
You will soon know to fear...
the power of the Dark Orb...

ROJAR:
Ugh...
I just wanted to meet her...
once more... once more...... 


MS008_EV3:
*HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
...Hasten the preparations of the troops
within the fortress.
I want Marth cornered like a rat... 


MS008_EV2:
*HARDIN enters*
HARDIN:
Heh heh heh... Prince, your struggle is in vain.
But let us continue this game for a while. 
Just know that you're fast running out of
time. Soon, I will kill you myself... 


MS008_EV1:
*HARDIN enters**MARS enters*
HARDIN:
Heh heh heh...
Prince Marth, it's been far too long. 

MARS:
Hardin...
Why did you to attack our country?
What would compel you to do such an act? 
I... I can't believe this.
Have you really changed this much? 

HARDIN:
Prince, I am the ruler of this continent and
the Emperor of Akaneia. 
I will show no quarter to anyone who opposes
me. That includes you, Prince... 
I must destroy this foul world...
It is beyond salvation. 
Traitors, playtime is over.
You will all die here. 
All soldiers, attack!
Do not leave a single traitor standing!

If ya ask me, archers'll always get along well
with archers.

*GOHDON enters**JORJUE enters*
GOHDON:
Master! Please, wait! 

JORJUE:
Hm...? Gordon?
Long time no see. 
You seem to have gotten a little sturdier,
but has your bow arm improved any? 

GOHDON:
Yes, at the moment, I...
They call me Aritia's master of bows. 
It's thanks to you, Master, that I've been
able to progress this far. 

JORJUE:
And?
Did you come here because you wanted to
challenge your old teacher? 

GOHDON:
N-no!
It's not like that... 
...I might be asking the impossible, but I'd like
you to fight alongside us again, sir. 

JORJUE:
...... 

GOHDON:
Please! Master!! 

JORJUE:
I pledged allegiance to Princess Nina,
but as for Hardin... 
I've had it with him.
Taking other countries by force,
executing "rebels" without reason. 
The Akaneian army I see now is just a
collection of hired thugs. 
There's not even a shred of chivalry left. 
To return the kingdom of Akaneia to what
it was once before... 
I must take it upon myself to turn my bow
against my homeland. 
Gordon.
Convey that to Prince Marth. 

GOHDON:
Thank you, Master!! 


MS008_TK2:
*MARS enters**JORJUE enters*
MARS:
Wait, Sir George.
I wish to speak with you. 

JORJUE:
Prince Marth... 
Please, lower your weapon.
I don't want to fight with you. 

MARS:
I know. As do I. 
You taught Gordon how to use a bow.
And you were an instructor to the junior
knights of Aritia. 
You've been a great boon to Aritia:
I could never fight you, Sir George. 

JORJUE:
Prince... 
I pledged allegiance to Princess Nina.
But I can tolerate Hardin no longer... 
Taking other countries by force,
executing "rebels" without reason... 

MARS:
...Hardin was my friend.
But he has changed beyond recognition. 
If he is committing any sort of crime, then
I shall stop him. George, please, help me. 

JORJUE:
...I understand, Prince. 
To return the kingdom of Akaneia to what
it was once before... 
I will take it upon myself to turn my bow
against my homeland. 


MS008_TK3:
*SHEEDA enters**ROJAR enters*
SHEEDA:
Good day, sir. 

ROJAR:
Ack!
You, y-you're... Sheeda! 

SHEEDA:
Thank goodness, Roger.
It's nice to see you again. 

ROJAR:
Uh...
Uhm, you should know, I've no plans to
betray Akaneia. 
I was just thinking about that time when you
asked me "do you believe in love?" 
But I'm different from who I was back then. 

SHEEDA:
Really? But you still seem like a nice man.
That's why I wanted to speak to you again. 

ROJAR:
Uhh... 

SHEEDA:
May I just ask, why are you fighting for
Akaneia? 

ROJAR:
Be-because Akaneia has already taken
over the world. Resistance is futile: no one
can win. 
My life is precious to me.
If I side with whoever's stronger, then I'm
guaranteed to live longer... 

SHEEDA:
I see. 

ROJAR:
A-are you disappointed with me? 

SHEEDA:
No, never.
As I thought, you're fighting for what you
believe in. 
You're not different.
You're the same, kind man as when I first
met you and I'm happy for that. 

ROJAR:
Uhhh... 
Wait- you're leaving?! 

SHEEDA:
Yes. I too must fight for what I believe in.
But I'll make a request to Marth so that we
don't have to fight you. 
I'm happy that we could talk again, Roger. 

ROJAR:
W-wait! 
...As I thought, you're still very kind.
Dare I say, we don't have girls quite like
you back in Grunia or Akaneia. 
Um, perhaps...
I suppose I could...
Aw heck, I'm going with you again! 


MS008_VIL1:
*MARS enters**BANUTU enters*
BANUTU:
Oh look, if it isn't Prince Marth.
Long time no see, Lad. 
It seems so noisy out;
I wonder what's happened? 

MARS:
Ah, Banutu!
Fancy meeting you in a place like this.
How is Chiki? 

BANUTU:
Oh, she is no longer by my side. 
Lord Gato took her to the Ice Dragon
Shrine again. 

MARS:
The Ice Dragons' Temple?
Where's that?
I've never heard of such a place... 

BANUTU:
It's in the icy lands, far north of here.
But it's no place for humans. 
Besides the hero Anri, no man has been
there yet. 

MARS:
Anri?!
Are you, perchance, referring to the
"Realm of the Gods" from Anri's legends? 

BANUTU:
I'm not at liberty to say anything more.
If you want to know more, you should ask
Lord Gato. 
Anyhow, I have a favor to ask of you.
My precious firestone was stolen by thieves. 
If you can get it back for me, I'll show you
how it works. Thank you, Prince Marth.
