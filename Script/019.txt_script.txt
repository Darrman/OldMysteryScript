*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
As expected, the Akaneian army
is extremely powerful.
We must approach with great caution. 

JEIGUN:
Hardin is gambling everything on
this one battle, and he appears to have
gathered the entire army of Akaneia here. 
But, any knights with a conscience
already joined the coup and have
nearly all been executed. 
All that remains are just weak
mercenaries, so you don't need to
fear them. 
Even so, the people have lost their
faith in Emperor Hardin.
They welcome us as liberators. 
It is certainly very reassuring. 
This is our final battle.
It may drag on but all the same,
I would ask that you take utmost care. 

MARS:
I understand.
Let's go, Jeigan.
I am worried about Midia.

MS019_EV1:
*BIRAKU enters*
BIRAKU:
I knew it.
You intend to invade Coyote's palace. 
The king forbade us from interfering...
But I will do anything to protect Coyote!
I'll defy his edict if I have to! 


MS019_TK1:
*ROSHE enters**BIRAKU enters*
ROSHE:
Biraku! Why are you here?
The king told us not to interfere. 
Aha! Have you decided to join the
Aritian army like me? 

BIRAKU:
Roshe, I came to bring you back. 
Why have you turned to the Aritians?
We are Coyote's subordinates. 
Open your eyes!
You're being deceived! 

ROSHE:
You're wrong, Biraku. 
The time I spent with the Aritians was
short, but I know one thing for sure. 
It's not as Coyote says.
They're not evil people. 

BIRAKU:
Roshe... 

ROSHE:
Biraku, please.
I don't want to fight all of you.
Especially you, Biraku... 

BIRAKU:
............ 
Well, Roshe...
You were always the kindest
out of us in the Wolfguard.. 
You've always been able to tell
which were the good guys,
and which were the bad. 
I can't fight you, Roshe.
If you, our brother-in-arms,
are this sure, then I believe you. 
I am your ally from now on. 

ROSHE:
Biraku...! 


MS019_TK2:
*BIRAKU enters**ZAGARO enters*
BIRAKU:
Zagaro, hold on.
It's me, Biraku. 

ZAGARO:
What's the meaning of this, Biraku?
Don't tell me you've defected!? 

BIRAKU:
Listen, Zagaro.
I--I don't know.
What am I supposed to do? 
I loved Coyote like a brother.
All I wanted was to fight for him. 
But...
But he has changed for the worse.
It's as though he's someone else now... 

ZAGARO:
...... 

BIRAKU:
I wanted to serve him, always.
That's why I've been turning a blind eye. 
I shut myself, trying to remember
the Coyote who loved us so long ago. 
It really hurt to face the truth.
That Coyote's not who he used to be... 
I just don't know anymore.
Hey, Zagaro...
What the hell am I supposed to do? 

ZAGARO:
Biraku... 
I too... I feel the same way.
I know he's gone insane, but I looked
the other way and blocked my senses. 
One day,
he'll go back to being our Coyote...
That's what I kept telling myself. 

BIRAKU:
Roshe has gone over to the Aritians.
I cannot fight him. 
Zagaro, you should come too.
I don't know what's right anymore.
But I don't want to fight you, either. 

ZAGARO:
Yes... 
Even though Coyote's madness
was clear to me, I did nothing.
I have to make this right. 


MS019_TK3:
*ZAGARO enters**WOLF enters*
ZAGARO:
Wolf! Hold your fire! 

WOLF:
Zagaro! What are you doing?!
So you've chosen to betray Coyote?! 

ZAGARO:
No, it's not like that!
This is for Coyote's own good! 
Something's wrong with Coyote.
Even you must know that! 

WOLF:
That changes nothing!
I will die at Coyote's side!
I swore as much! 
Though all of you might betray us.
Though I might be alone.
I will not abandon him! 

ZAGARO:
Even though you disobey his heart? 

WOLF:
What do you mean!? 

ZAGARO:
Wolf, do you remember what Coyote said
to you, the day you became commander
of the Wolfguard? 

WOLF:
......! 

ZAGARO:
"If I should wander from the path of the
righteous, please... lead me back onto it."
That's what he said. 

WOLF:
I should never have forgotten.
The words of Coyote himself... 
But, to tell me that time has come...
That we must...
That we must defeat Coyote... 

ZAGARO:
We have to remind Coyote of the day
we swore allegiance to him. 
No matter how painful it may be...
That is our only recourse. 
I never wanted to believe it
would come to this... 

WOLF:
Enough, Zagaro! 
For goodness sake...
It would have been better
had I died at Adria Pass... 
I am the commander of the Wolfguard...
The life that Coyote gave me...
I will not waste it. 
Even if that should lead to
Coyote's death... 


MS019_VIL1:
*MARS enters**ROSHE enters*
ROSHE:
Prince Marth...
It is I, Roshe of the Wolfguard. 
I received King Orleans's pardon
and have been waiting for you. 
I am truly sorry for the battle of the pass. 
I realize that an apology means little,
so I will now fight under your banner. 
But... the other Wolfguard members
have all sided with the Akaneian army.
I wonder if I could persuade them. 
Biraku, at the least...
Biraku might listen to what I have to say. 


MS019_VIL1_B:
*MARS enters**WOMAN1 enters*
WOMAN1:
Sir Roshe of the Wolfguard had always
opposed the battle against Aritia. 
But, he...
In the battle of the pass...
He perished. 
I don't hold it against you.
That's just how war is... 
Here, take this.
All we want is for this war to end soon. 


MS019_H1:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
Lord Hardin was once a kind man.
Then all of a sudden, it's as if
he's a terrifying demon... 
Ahem...
If they 'ear me saying these things,
it'll be off with my 'ead as well. 


MS019_H2:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
The Paladin Midia is the pride of Akaneia. 
She's the daughter of Akaneia's former
supreme commander, Count Owen. 
She couldn't bear to watch our suffering,
so she stood up for us and rebelled. 
Hey, you...
Please, find a way to help Lady Midia. 


MS019_H3:
*WOMAN2 enters*
WOMAN2:
When Princess Nina and Prince Hardin
were married, I thought "peace at last".
But now everything's gone insane. 
Oh, God...
What on earth are we supposed to do...? 


MS019_H4:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
Such a pity, what befell Lady Midia. 
She'd just left the ranks and
taken up with Astria, but now
they've been torn apart again. 
It's horrible, for that to
happen to such a young woman.
Can't you do something about it...? 


MS019_H5:
*MAN2 enters*
MAN2:
The Akaneian army has changed.
The soldiers you see now ain't nothin'
but bloodthirsty cutthroats. 
What's goin' to happen to this kingdom? 


MS019_H6:
*OLDWOMAN enters*
OLDWOMAN:
Sigh, these are dark days. 
All those who oppose Emperor Hardin
just wind up getting killed... 
Our emperor's possessed by a demon... 


MS019_BT_BIRAKU:

As long as we're around
you shall not reach Pales.
If you don't wish to die, go home! 


MS019_BT_BOSS:

NERING:
Gah... It's not possible...
That we Akaneians could be defeated! 
But, as long as I stand here, you
shall not enter this palace!

Why are you invading other nations?
Are you so consumed by petty ambition?!

MS019_ED1:
*MARS enters**Y_BOHA enters*
MARS:
Bishop Boa!?
You're hurt...!
What on earth happened? 

Y_BOHA:
Ngh... this is terrible...
House Akaneia must truly be cursed. 
As you know, two years ago...
Hardin and Princess Nina were wed. 
In order to restore Akaneia to glory,
a king was needed. 
There were but two suitable individuals:
King Orleans's younger brother, Duke Hardin,
and you, Prince Marth of Aritia... 
Princess Nina begged me to wait
just a while longer, but once
I insisted of its absolute urgency... 
She said that it could not be you,
for Princess Sheeda would grieve.
In the end, Hardin was our only choice... 

MARS:
Let me get this straight.
I understand that Akaneia
could not be without a king. 
But Princess Nina, she already... 

Y_BOHA:
You speak of Sir Camus of Grunia?
The people must never know...
'Twould be heresy. 
The decision cost us dearly,
but what choice did we have?
It was for our country. 
On the bright side, Hardin was happy. 
In fact, the thought that he was to
be Princess Nina's husband pleased him
greater than his ascension to the throne. 

MARS:
I know of his feelings. 
I know that he would have given
his life for Princess Nina. 
But, did he know about Camus?
If he did, I don't believe
he would be so happy. 


MS019_ED1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
Mmm... Of course we kept that a secret,
and we also persuaded Nina to hide it
as best as she could.[A}
But, Lord Hardin was a very sensitive man. 
He soon realized that
Princess Nina did not reciprocate his love. 
It pained him greatly...
He shut himself into his room, drinking
away his sorrows, and saw no one. 
Spotting an opportune moment,
as Hardin wallowed in heartbreak,
Garnef appeared. 
He took on the guise of a merchant
to approach Hardin, and showed
him the Dark Orb. 
The despairing emperor's heart was
gripped by the Dark Orb in an instant. 
He completely changed as a
person from then. 
I've made a terrible mistake,
out of my concern for this kingdom.
Please forgive me, Prince Marth... 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
So that's how it is.
...And what of Princess Nina?
How is she now? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
When Hardin discovered that she had
taken the Emblem Shield, he had her
confined in her room. 
After that, she would still communicate
in secret with me. 
However, Hardin found out and wounded me. 
He then handed Princess Nina to Garnef. 
Garnef said that he required the blood
of noble-born clerics in order to resurrect
the Dark Dragon... 
And so...
He took Nina...
To use her as a live sacrifice... 
Prince Marth, my end is nigh.
I shall give you my tome and staff. 
Please save Princess Nina. 
Even if Akaneia's destruction
cannot be undone... 
Make sure that she is safe...
