MS018_OP1:
*ROSHE enters*
ROSHE:
Wolf, Zagaro, Biraku.
Do you not have second thoughts...?
Does the battle plan not trouble you? 
*WOLF enters*
WOLF:
Roshe!
Are you still babbling on about
that nonsense? 
Look over there!
The Aritian forces are stretched along
the narrow pass. 
Our only chance to crush them is now. 
*WOLF leaves**BIRAKU enters*
BIRAKU:
What's wrong with you, Roshe?
Did the four of us not all pledge that
we would die for Coyote? 
It was Coyote who freed us
plain dwellers from slavery. 
If we don't fight Aritia here,
then we can't protect Pales. 
Are you telling me you WANT
Hardin to be defeated by them? 
*BIRAKU leaves**ZAGARO enters*
ZAGARO:
That's right!
Prince Marth wants to destroy
Akaneia and everything we hold dear. 
That's why he joined forces with Macedonia
to crush Grunia. Now he even has Gra
under his control. 
If we leave him be, the entire world
will eventually fall into his hands. 

ROSHE:
I still find it hard to believe.
So the honorable Prince Marth we met is
supposed to harbor diabolical ambitions? 
*ZAGARO leaves**WOLF enters*
WOLF:
Are you calling Coyote a liar?! 
Do you really believe that he would
resort to such deceitful tactics?! 
Enough, Roshe!!
I've lost all respect for you.
Betray us if you want, I don't care. 
Zagaro, Biraku, let's go.
If we delay any more they will pass us. 

ROSHE:
Hey, wait!
You know I can't betray you.
I understand... I'll go, too. 


MS018_EV1:
*MARS enters*
MARS:
The Wolfguard of Orleans!
Must we fight them as well...? 
*JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, please hold on.
We've just received word from a
messenger of King Orleans. 
It seems Orleans has no plans to war... 


MS018_EV1_2:

INSERTNAMEHERE:
According to the messenger, King Orleans
wishes to parley with you in the village. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
What? What could this mean?
That the Wolfguard is moving independent
of Orleans's orders? 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I don't know, but... Depending on
how negotiations go, it's possible
the Wolfguard may signal a retreat. 

INSERTNAMEHERE:
I see. It would benefit us all
if we could avoid pointless fighting.
Let's hurry to the village! 


MS018_VIL1:
*MARS enters**ORLEAN_KING enters*
ORLEAN_KING:
Oh, Prince Marth.
Thank the stars I could meet you here. 

MARS:
King Orleans?
What brings you here? 

ORLEAN_KING:
I came to halt our attack.
And I must apologize to you. 
I believed Hardin and sided with Akaneia,
but it seems that I made a mistake. 
Akaneia's Empress Nina secretly sent me
a letter, saying that Hardin isn't
normal and is ill... 
Orleans has decided to maintain neutrality.
My knights will return to their lands. 
I hope you won't attack my men anymore.
MARS:
I understand, Your Majesty.
I do not wish to fight you, either. 
Please, find it in yourself to forgive me
for the many Orleanian lives that I've taken. 

ORLEAN_KING:
Ohh!
The rumors are true, as I suspected. 
I am old and frail, and without children.
And now, the brother I once trusted
has become... like this. 
Prince Marth, please,
protect Orleans in my stead.
I entrust everything to you. 
As a sign of my allegiance,
I would have you accept this orb. 
This is a magical jewel containing
the divine power of life. 
I spent a lot of gold to buy it
from a travelling merchant. 
I believe it will be useful to you. 

MARS:
Your Majesty, Hardin is... 

ORLEAN_KING:
Do not worry about my younger brother. 
A knight can only die a knight's death.
'Twas always his fate... 


MS018_BT_BIRAKU:
*BIRAKU enters*
BIRAKU:
As long as we're around
you will not reach Pales.
If you value your lives then turn around! 


MS018_BT_ROSHE:
*ROSHE enters*
ROSHE:
I am Roshe of the Wolfguard.
I don't want to fight, but I will not
betray my friends. I'm sorry... 


MS018_BT_WOLF:
*WOLF enters*
WOLF:
I am Wolf, commander of the Wolfguard.
Your head is mine! 


MS018_BT_ZAGARO:
*ZAGARO enters*
ZAGARO:
You...
Why are you invading other countries?
Are you so blinded by your ambition?! 


MS018_DIE_BIRAKU:
*BIRAKU enters*
BIRAKU:
Coyote... 


MS018_DIE_ROSHE:

ROSHE:
Coyote...

Coyote...

*ZAGARO enters*
ZAGARO:
Coyote...

*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
Jeigan, we've made it through.
Pales is not far. 

JEIGUN:
Yes, if we go down from here, we will
reach the capital of Pales in an instant. 
*JEIGUN leaves**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
Sire, we've just received urgent news.
Apparently a coup d'etat broke out
in Pales. 
The knights and citizens who opposed
Emperor Hardin's ways rose in rebellion. 
It seems their leader was Lady Midia. 

MARS:
What in the blazes?!
What has happened to them now? 

JEIGUN:
Unfortunately, the instigators were all
defeated and captured... 
Rumor has it that the rebels
are being executed by the day. 
It is only a matter of time before
Lady Midia shares the same fate.
MARS:
Damn it, Hardin...
This is absurd. 
Alright, let's go and rescue Midia! We
will head for Pales at once and end this.
Jeigan, let's go!!
