MS023_OP1:
*MARS enters**GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
So you've come, boy.
How many times must you get in my way?
Enough! I tire of our games!! 

MARS:
Garnef, what have you done with
my sister and the others?!
Release them at once! 

GARNEF:
Heh heh heh... I've allowed them the honor
of being sacrifices for the Dark Dragon's
resurrection. You will never see them again. 
Emperor Mediuth will soon be reborn
in his true and darkest form,
requiring the sisters as live sacrifices. 

And they will usher in a new era. 
'Tis a pity. Their souls couldn't bear
the suffering and shattered into pieces...
Even I am powerless to help them. 
Shame, really. I have them to thank for
the Dark Dragon's awakening. Not even the
Shield of Seals can stop him now. 
I applaud you for coming this far.
But... little prince...
you will go no further. 
I will kill you here, and you will die
knowing that you are nothing!!

GARNEF:
Heh heh heh...
Perhaps...
a taste of Maph's might is necessary.

*GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
Your blade is blunt before me, Marth...
I'll smash you and the Shield of Seals
into pieces!! 
*MARS enters*
MARS:
I do not intend to fall here.
Out of my way, Garnef!

Heh heh heh...
Allow me demonstrate Maph's might... 
*PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
I will not let Prince Marth die.
I won't let the likes of you lay
even a finger on him...! 


MS023_DIE_BOSS:
*GARNEF enters*
GARNEF:
Heh heh...
You're too late...
The end is nigh...

There are stairs here, leading up.
