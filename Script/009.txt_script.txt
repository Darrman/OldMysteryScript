MS009_OP1:
*MINERBA enters**MISHEIL enters*
MISHEIL:
Minerva, if you wait in this village,
you will most certainly run into Marth. 
I don't like him, but he is indeed noble.
Join forces with him. 

MINERBA:
Brother, what are you going to do now?
Won't you come with me...? 

MISHEIL:
I have no intention of doing that.
I only wish to find Maria and bring her home
to Macedonia. 

MINERBA:
You've changed, Brother...
Or should I say, you've returned to how you
used to be. 
As I thought, back then you were being
controlled by Garnef's dark magic. 

MISHEIL:
No, no magic could bend my will. 
I wished to crush the arrogant Akaneia,
and establish Macedonian supremacy over
this continent. 
I originally planned to ally with Durhua
to destroy Akaneia, and then later join
forces with Grunia's Camus to defeat Durhua. 
But Father, without bending his ear to me,
distanced himself from me and later had me
banished. 

MINERBA:
Are you saying that's why you murdered
Father? 
What a fool you were...
Didn't you realize that was Garnef's
plotting all along? 
Yes, Father was strict with you. 
But it was only because he loved you.
Why couldn't you see that? 

MISHEIL:
Enough, Minerva.
Do you take me for a fool? 
After I was defeated, I wandered the gap
between life and death. 
When I had come to, in front of me,
I saw Maria--her eyes full of tears--
praying to the gods. 
She saved me, by selflessly and tirelessly
taking care of me, even though her
face was completely in tears. 
I don't believe in the gods, but at that time
she truly looked like an angel. 
While I treated her like a pawn,
Maria, she shed tears for me... 
Minerva, I'm going now.
I have to save Maria.
At least that can be my atonement! 

MINERBA:
Misheil... 


MS009_OP2_PCF1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
MARS:
Jeigan, everybody appears to be safe.
That's great to see. 

JEIGUN:
Sire.
How shall we proceed from here? 

MARS:
Hmm... I want to go home to Aritia,
but if we can't prevail against Hardin,
then we can't go back. 
What in the world are we supposed to do...? 

JEIGUN:
Sire, it's an emergency!
I have just come into some new information. 
The Khadein mage corps has launched an
offensive against us. 

MARS:
What!?
Even Khadein means to be our enemy...
Marich, what are you... 

JEIGUN:
At this rate, it seems we have no choice. 

JEIGUN:
Sire, we need to break into the sanctuary,
but you must be prepared to make sacrifices. 
If we don't hurry, Akaneia's pursuit force
will reach our rear and we'll be trapped. 

MARS:
I understand. We've no choice. 
Everyone, let's break into the sanctuary!
But avoid needless fights if possible! 


MS009_OP2_PCM1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*

That's great to see. 

JEIGUN:

MS009_EV1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
An update, sire!
The Akaneia army is, at present,
approaching from the south. 

MARS:
I see.
Hasten the march;
don't let them catch up! 


MS009_EV2A:
*ASTRIA enters*
ASTRIA:
Do not think you can escape, Aritians.
I'll turn this desert into your graveyard. 


MS009_EV2B:
*SOLDIER_RED enters*
SOLDIER_RED:
Do not think you can escape, Aritians.
We will avenge Captain Astria! 


MS009_H1:
*LADY enters*
LADY:
From here on north, you won't see no more
shops. 
If you're going that way, you should stock
up now. 


MS009_H2:
*OLDMAN enters*
OLDMAN:
A swordslayer will demonstrate your might
against a mercenary or a hero. 
You should definitely get one if you can. 


MS009_H3:
*MAN1 enters*
MAN1:
The person commanding Khadein's mage
corps is a young man named Ellerean. 
He's not a bad man, but he can be a bit
uncooperative. 
Seems he regards his old rival, Marich,
with disdain. 
Hmm...
I reckon only Lord Wendel could talk some
sense into him. 


MS009_TK1:
*MARS enters**ETZEL enters*
MARS:
You're... Etzel!
Why are you here? 

ETZEL:
I have my ties to Khadein as well. 
"Prince Marth has succumbed to his
ambitions and invaded Akaneia." 
When I was told that, there was no way I
could sit still! 

MARS:
...... 

ETZEL:
But... No matter how I put it, I just couldn't
imagine you'd become that sort of person. 
Prince Marth, you said to me long ago that
you wanted to let the era of war end. 
Do you still stand by those words? 

MARS:
Yes, I do.
I do not seek to fight. 

ETZEL:
...I see.
I, too, do not seek as such.
Allow me to join you once more. 


MS009_VIL1:
*MARS enters**MINERBA enters*
MARS:
Huh?
Princess Minerva, why are you here? 

MINERBA:
My brother... Misheil, he helped me. 

MARS:
Really? That's good to hear.
I was so worried once I heard that
Prince Misheil had taken you. 
But, for him to rescue you:
what in the world happened? 

MINERBA:
Maria saved Misheil's life. 
She's kind, unlike myself... 
Maria's kindness was able to touch the
heart of even a man like Misheil. 

MARS:
But, isn't that what you wanted?
That's why you deliberately avoided killing
Misheil. 
Am I wrong, Princess? 

MINERBA:
Hmm...... 

MARS:
I can understand.
No one can sever the ties between family
so easily. 
Princess, please lift your spirits.
I would like you to fight with us again,
just like before. 
I would like Macedonia's strength and yours
in order to put a stop to Hardin's designs. 


MS009_BT_ASTRIA:
*ASTRIA enters*
ASTRIA:
You traitors!
I'll show you the might of Miracle!! 


MS009_BT_BOSS:
*YODEL enters*
YODEL:
I will not forgive intruders upon our
holy sanctuary!
Earth, show your fury! Bolganone!! 


MS009_BT_ETZEL:
*ETZEL enters*
ETZEL:
I don't want to fight you, but I owe Khadein.
What a troublesome ordeal I am in... 


MS009_DIE_ASTRIA:
*ASTRIA enters*
ASTRIA:
Midia... My love... 


MS009_DIE_BOSS:
*YODEL enters*
YODEL:
Ellerean...
Was this really what you wanted...? 


MS009_DIE_ETZEL:
*ETZEL enters*
ETZEL:
This war... will... someday... 

MS009_ED1_PCF1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
The atmosphere inside the building seems
somewhat strange. 

MARS:
Indeed, something seems to be happening. 
Let's go, Jeigan.
I'm worried about Marich! 


MS009_ED1_PCM1:
*MARS enters**JEIGUN enters*
JEIGUN:
