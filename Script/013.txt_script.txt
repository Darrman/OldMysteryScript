2*MARS enters**CHEINE enters*
MARS:
Are we there yet, Chainy?
We've climbed so high already. 
It's freezing and...
It's becoming increasingly difficult to
breathe... 

CHEINE:
Just hang on a bit longer, princey. 
Look, you can see it, right?
That's the Ice Dragons' Temple over there.
Where Gato's waitin' for you. 

MARS:
You know, I must admit, I was shocked when
you told me that Chiki was the daughter of
the Divine Dragon King. 
And that you and Gato were both divine
dragons. 

CHEINE:
Oh, yeah... When the Divine Dragons fought the
Earth Dragons they wore out their dragon
stones, and so practically became extinct. 
Aside from Narga, only Gato, me and the
newborn Chiki survived. 
Y'see, after the war, Gato
and I threw away our dragon stones.
So, I can never be a dragon again. 
Sure, Gato still stands by Narga's command
and watches out for humans... 
But that ain't my thing. 
Y'see, I don't like humans. 
I've got nothin' but contempt for those
who treated the defenseless Mamkutes like
insects. 
So I can understand why Mediuth despised
you humans so. 
Mediuth, an Earth Dragon prince, tricked
his own tribe and he alone became a Mamkute. 
And, as ordered by Narga, he guarded the
Dragon's Altar. 
But the once peaceful human race, drunk
with power, began to rule with tyranny. 
They oppressed the dragons who had done
nothin' wrong. 
Furious at their betrayal by humans,
the Mamkutes gathered in Durhua, 
and they created a nation for their people.
Then they fought to conquer humanity. 
To save the humans, Gato gave them the
divine sword Falchion. 
He established an academy in Khadein,
and began to teach magic. 
Me? I was just an onlooker.
Winner or loser, it was no concern of mine. 

MARS:
But then, why help me?
I too am human... 

CHEINE:
You're different.
You don't seem like an unreliable
person either... 

MARS:
Mmm...
Thanks, Chainy. 

CHEINE:
I... Oh, look at me.
I'm blushin'. 
Anyway, let's head to the shrine.
But watch out for the ice dragons. 
Even though they've lost their minds,
they still protect the shrine instinctively.
The poor creatures...

MARS:
You, you're Beck!
To think we'd meet here of all places! 

BECK:
Me too, Prince Marth.
Boy am I surprised to see you.
It's been far too long. 
After the war, I was travelin' the continent.
And, um, somehow... 

MARS:
...You landed up here?
Well, thank goodness. There's no way you
would have joined the barbarians. 
Beck, we're fighting another war.
Why don't you come with us? 

BECK:
I don't have my ballista any more.
Just my horse-buddy right 'ere. 
But if you're fine with that, then sure.
I'll help you princey.

2*MARS enters**CHEINE enters*
MARS:
There's something that's been bothering me. 
The five orbs are very important, correct?
But Lord Gato never told us much about
them. 
Do you know anything about them, Chainy? 

CHEINE:
Well, Gato kept his lips shut 'cause he was
afraid of givin' you a heart attack. 
Tell you what, I'll tell you about 'em.
But I have to warn you, you might be
better off not knowing... 
The orbs are meant for the shield that binds
the earth dragons... 
In other words, they were once embedded in
the shield itself. 
The orbs have been handed down for
generations amongst the divine dragons
and each contains a hidden power. 
The shield itself is but a pedestal for the
five orbs to release their innate powers. 
If even one orb is missing, the seal's a goner. 

MARS:
I see.
But if that's the case, why were the orbs
separated? 

CHEINE:
'Cause the shield broke. 
The Shield of Seals that was enshrined in the
Raman Temple was stolen. 

MARS:
When exactly did this happen? 

CHEINE:
Six hundred years ago, I reckon.
Gato scoured the lands searchin' for the
shield, hopin' to get it back. 
He managed to retrieve the five orbs,
but in the end, he couldn't find the shield. 
Then, in the last war... 
The Raman Temple was looted and the orbs
were scattered once more. 

MARS:
I see.
So the orbs that Lord Gato lost...
He's searching for them again? 

CHEINE:
Yep. I'm sure you know about the Star Orb,
Light Orb and Earth Orb... 
But there's also the Dark Orb and
Life Orb. 
Gato's got the Light Orb, but the
Star Orb's in pieces, 
and it sounds like Garnef gave the
Dark Orb to Hardin. 

MARS:
The Earth Orb is in Aritia, so all that remains
is the Life Orb. 

CHEINE:
Anyway, let's go inside.
I'll be helpin' you too.
Now, come on, princey!

Sire, please wait.

JEIGUN:
, you as well. 
*PLAYER leaves**MARS enters*
JEIGUN:
I just received a distressing message.
People have been sighted not far behind us. 
There seems to be a battle underway. 

MARS:
Out here?
Could it be the barbarians?
Or perhaps it's the assassins... 

JEIGUN:
In any case, this area is almost entirely
uninhabited. So it can't be any old people... 
To make matters worse, the snow is becoming
heavier... Fighting will be difficult in this
weather. 

MARS:
But if there are allies... 
*JEIGUN leaves**PLAYER enters*
PLAYER:
Indeed. We cannot abandon them.
If there are allies that is...

Then we'll just have to find out for ourselves,
before the battle is over. Let's go!
