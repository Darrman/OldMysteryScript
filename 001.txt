[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN]Sire,[Pause=3] this is General Lang, the commanding
officer of the occupational forces.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=RANG][FaceCommand=0x73]Oho, so you are Prince Marth?[Pause=3]
Glad you could make it here.[A][ClearBox]Since you've come all this way, I suppose
I'll let you have the glory of capturing the
rebel leader,[Pause=3] General Lawrence.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]What[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
General Lawrence leads the rebels[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3][A][ClearBox]What would possess him to rebel of all
things[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Who knows[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I[Pause=3] haven't the foggiest idea, and frankly
I don't care.[A][ClearBox]Prince.[Pause=3] You are to kill General Lawrence,
and reclaim the children of the Grunian
royal family that he's hiding.[A][ClearBox]While you do that[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]We will slaughter the families of those who
participated in this rebellion[Pause=3] and raze their
homes to the ground.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Are you insane[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
They're innocent civilians[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]"I-[Pause=3]insane[FreezeMouth]"!?[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Young man,[Pause=3] are you questioning my orders[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox]Perhaps[Pause=3] Aritia, too, plans to rebel against
Akaneia[FreezeMouth]...?[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight]Of course not[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] That's not[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetLeft]
Prince Marth,[Pause=3] your tiny country means
absolutely nothing to me.[A][ClearBox]Your rude behaviour is merely an irritation.[A][ClearBox]Do not forget that I have the power of the
empire behind me:[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]I can crush weak, pesky insects like you
any time I wish.[A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_OP1_02
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=JEIGUN][TargetRight]Jeigan[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
What in the world is going on here?[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]How could Hardin have entrusted this
country to such a vile man[FreezeMouth]?[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]
General Lang was once a noble of Akaneia.
However, in the previous war, he
supported the Durhua Empire. I heard[A][ClearBox]that he stole from other people,
to add to his own wealth. I fear he has
continued his ways at Grunia, and[A][ClearBox]caused suffering to its people. So
General Lawrence's rebellion is
completely understandable.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Jeigan! How can you say things
so casually? If we don't inform Hardin of
the truth, more innocent people will be killed.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Sire,[Pause=3] I understand how you feel.[Pause=3]
However, Lawrence has begun a rebellion.[Pause=3][A][ClearBox]That much seems to be true, so we ought
to do something about that first.[A][ClearBox]Sire, why don't you try speaking to
General Lawrence personally?[A][ClearBox]
[TargetRight]But the rebels don't know that we're
from Aritia.
Can we reach the fortress safely?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't worry.
Most of the rebels have already fled.
All that remains is Lawrence, and the[A][ClearBox]children in the fortress. Blocking our
path are only bandits, who have taken
advantage of the confusion to raid[A][ClearBox]villages. They are no problem for us.
You can order Alan to defeat them
in one blow if you want. However,[A][ClearBox]your highness, we have some fresh
recruits in our army that could use
some fighting experience.[A][ClearBox]To them, bandits are relatively strong foes.
So be careful not to push them too much.
If possible, I would have liked to fight as[A][ClearBox]well, but my body is not what it used to be.
Allow me to stay by your side and serve
as your tactician.[A][ClearBox][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

MS001_EV0
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=BANDIT][LoadBackground=BBG38][TargetLeft]Oh? A battle, is it?[Pause=3] We're in luck, boys!
Let's loot 'em villages before 'ey realize
what's hit 'em[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_EV1
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROLENSE][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=OGUMA][LoadBackground=BBG40][TargetLeft]Alright,[Pause=3] that will do for now[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Sir Oguma,[Pause=3] please forgive me for getting you
involved in this mess.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]I am here on King Talis's orders.[A][ClearBox]As such, I will do everything in my power to
help.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I see[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Then I have a favor to ask of you.[Pause=3]
I want you to escort these children to
Macedonia.[A][ClearBox]These children[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Prince Yubello and Princess Yumina,
are King Grunia's orphans.[A][ClearBox]I have always been protecting them in
secret, but that is no longer possible.[A][ClearBox]If they fell into General Lang's hands, I
bet he would execute them without question.[A][ClearBox]Please.
Take them safely to Lord Wendel in
Macedonia.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Understood[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I will guard these two with my life.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Thank you, [Pause=3]Sir Oguma[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A]
[ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=YUMINA][TargetLeft]Now, [Pause=3]Prince Yubello, [Pause=3]Princess Yumina,
you will be leaving with Sir Oguma.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'm not going![Pause=3]
I won't leave you behind![A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Princess[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I cannot go.[A][ClearBox]With this wound, I can barely even walk.[A][ClearBox]It saddens me, but you two must go on
without me.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]You took that grievous wound to protect us[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]How can you tell us to just leave you behind
now[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]I[Pause=3] will never leave.[Pause=3]
We will never leave your side, Lawrence[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=OGUMA]What shall I do, [Pause=3]General?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Hmm[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] this is most troublesome.[A][ClearBox]Princess Yumina is not one to change her
mind easily[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] We will remain here.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]In that case,[Pause=3] I will find some other way to
help you.[A][ClearBox]I will find Lang and bring him down[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I will bury him with this sword, I swear on it.[A][ClearBox]General Lawrence,[Pause=3] you must hold out until then[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_TK1
[TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=ROLENSE][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG40][TargetLeft]Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth]
So it is you[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]How unfortunate,[Pause=3] that I must fight[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
the Aritian Army and its prince[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetRight]Please, wait.[Pause=3]
I do not wish to fight with you.[A][ClearBox]I heard about everything from the villagers.[Pause=3]
I've heard of all the atrocities Akaneia
has committed.[A][ClearBox]I promise, I will inform Emperor Hardin of
the truth and rescue Grunia.[A][ClearBox]So please,[Pause=3] lower your weapons.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Prince[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
I am [Pause=3]grateful for the offer.[A][ClearBox]But,[Pause=3] I am afraid that I cannot comply.[Pause=3]
Prince, you know nothing.[A][ClearBox]Do you think that a man of Emperor Hardin's
caliber would make a general out of a man as
worthless as Lang without good reason?[A][ClearBox]He called for an invasion: to crush the
kingdom of Grunia and make it a territory
of the Empire.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight]No, it can't be[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Hardin would never do something like that.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]I know it's hard to believe.[Pause=3]
But I'm afraid that, ever since he became
emperor, he has changed a great deal.[A][ClearBox]He is no longer the Hardin you once knew.[A][ClearBox]Prince,[Pause=3] I have one final request of you.[A][ClearBox]In this stronghold, [Pause=3]I am protecting the young
prince and princess of Grunia.[A][ClearBox]Please, find a way to help them.[A][ClearBox]If you can do just that, I will have no regrets.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FreezeMouth]What...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
General Lawrence, what are you saying[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Prince Marth[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
My life in exchange for theirs[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
By any means necessary, please help them[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]This is the last thing I will ask[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][RemovePortrait][FaceCommand=0x40][FaceCommand=0x68][X]

[TargetRight]General Lawrence[FreezeMouth]!![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth]This can't be happening[FreezeMouth]......[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_H1
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=LADY][LoadBackground=BBG25]I only saw him briefly, but that knight, Alan,
looked awfully pale.[A][ClearBox]You know,[Pause=3] he's probably hit the wall, so to
speak.[A][ClearBox]I doubt he'll get any stronger, no matter how
much he fights[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_H2
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=UNCLE][LoadBackground=BBG25]There aren't any young girls left in this
country.[A][ClearBox]They were all taken away by the imperial
troops.[A][ClearBox]They say General Lang keeps the really
pretty ones to himself.[A][ClearBox]What a dark, insane chapter in Grunia's
history...[A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_H3
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=OLDMAN][LoadBackground=BBG25]The late King Grunia had two children.[A][ClearBox]Princess Yumina and Prince Yubello.
They're still young.[A][ClearBox]Maybe thirteen,[Pause=3] or fourteen;[Pause=3]
cute little twins, both of them.[A][ClearBox]In the last war, Garnef, the Demon King,
kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king.[A][ClearBox]They were taken to Khadein, the city of magic,
and locked away in a pitch-black room.[A][ClearBox]At great personal risk, Archbishop Wendel
saved them.[A][ClearBox]He took them to a monastery to protect them.[A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_H4
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=MAN1][LoadBackground=BBG25]General Lawrence took the royal children from
Lord Wendel and raised them in Grunia.[A][ClearBox]The empire demanded their extradition,
but Lawrence was afraid they would be killed,
and hid them.[A][ClearBox]The empire branded Lawrence a traitor,
and sent General Lang here.[A][ClearBox]Lang did horrible things[Pause=3] to find the royal
children.[Pause=3] That's why we rose up.[A][ClearBox]But,[Pause=3] we lost.[Pause=3]
And now Lang is going to kill everyone in
this entire country[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_H5
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=MAN1][LoadBackground=BBG25]I heard that General Lawrence lived in Talis
when he was young.[A][ClearBox]Talis wasn't unified at the time, so there
were a number of noble houses contending
for control.[A][ClearBox]Lawrence lent his power to the young patriarch
of one house,[Pause=3] and together they unified
Talis into one country.[A][ClearBox]Lawrence and that patriarch[SpecialSymbol=0x96]now the king of
Talis[SpecialSymbol=0x96]remain close friends to this day.[A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_H6
[TargetCenter][LoadPortrait=WOMAN1][LoadBackground=BBG25]After the last war,[Pause=3] Princess Nina let this
country keep its sovereignty under the rule
of General Lawrence.[A][ClearBox]However,[Pause=3] as soon as Hardin became
emperor, General Lawrence was banished
and Lang's troops came crawling in.[A][ClearBox]Lang stole everything from us.[A][ClearBox]He stole our gold, of course,[Pause=3] but he even
stole our food and our loved ones[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][A][ClearBox]Ah[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
If only General Camus were here![A][ClearBox]Then we wouldn't have to live in fear of
people like Lang![A][ClearBox][X]

MS001_VIL1
[TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARS][LoadBackground=BBG26][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=OLDWOMAN][TargetLeft]Oh[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth]
Please, show mercy to just this child.[Pause=3]
She's only ten years old.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]Ma'am,[Pause=3] please calm yourself.[Pause=3]
I am not here to take any children.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]What[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
You're not imperial soldiers?[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][FaceCommand=0x73]No[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] We're not.[Pause=3]
We didn't come to fight.[A][ClearBox]If there's anything you need, please ask.[Pause=3]
It's not much, but we can give you food.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=MARICIA][TargetLeft][FaceCommand=0x61]Wait[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

You're[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] Are you really ten?[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]No[FreezeMouth]...[UnfreezeMouth] I'm a grown woman, but[Pause=3] Granny lied so
that I wouldn't be taken away by the soldiers.[A][ClearBox]Lang's soldiers are all monstrous.[Pause=3]
But you're different.[Pause=3]
You have very sweet eyes.[A][ClearBox]Please, [Pause=3]take me with you.[Pause=3]
I want you to take me away from this
country, and take me to yours.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft][LoadPortrait=OLDWOMAN]It's not safe for her to stay here.[Pause=3]
Please take her with you, and protect her.[A][ClearBox]You can marry her, too, if you like.[A][ClearBox]Malliesia is a beautiful, good-natured lady,
just like me[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3] I'm sure she'll make a fine
wife.[A][ClearBox][TargetRight][LoadPortrait=MARICIA][FaceCommand=0x73]No-no-no[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]
Granny, it's far too early for that[FreezeMouth]![UnfreezeMouth][Pause=3]

Allow me to take custody of them.[A][ClearBox][TargetLeft]Don't make me laugh.[Pause=3]
These brats are coming with me to my castle.[A][ClearBox]I must also execute them as soon as

How could that happen to Macedonia[FreezeMouth]?![UnfreezeMouth][A]
